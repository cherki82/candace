# Candace Knowledge Graph

An open-source research database documenting Candace Owens' investigations into the Charlie Kirk assassination, the Brigitte Macron controversy, and related topics.

This project uses AI to automatically transcribe episodes, extract entities (people, organizations, places), identify claims, build timelines, and map relationships—making it easy to search, verify, and cross-reference information across hundreds of hours of content.
