### Analysis

Multiple posts from Candace Owens' official X account, including this one dated 2025-12-03, consistently state that her podcast team consists of just 4 people (including herself) working on it daily. This matches the claim in the podcast transcript, with named team members (Savannah, Chris, Mark, Skylar) aligning with a small team of four. No contradicting evidence from reliable sources was found in web searches or other X posts.
