### Analysis

The interview between Brian Harpole and Shawn Ryan (likely intended as 'Sean Ryan' in the claim) exists and is documented in multiple sources, including news articles from Deseret News and KSL.com that report on Harpole's recounting of events without labeling them as lies. However, posts on X (formerly Twitter) contain user accusations of specific lies (e.g., about a 'trap door,' EMT presence, or drones), but these are inconclusive opinions and not supported by established news outlets or official investigations. No primary sources like fact-check articles, official statements, or documents confirm or refute deception. Verification would require access to the full interview transcript, cross-referenced with police reports, video footage, or eyewitness accounts from the event (e.g., via FOIA requests to Orem PD or Utah authorities) to check specific statements against evidence.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Compare Harpole's interview with Sean Ryan to original communications
