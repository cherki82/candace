### Analysis

Searches for New York Post articles matching the claim returned no results confirming an exclusive photo of the gun published at 9:21 a.m. Mountain Time (11:21 a.m. Eastern) on September 11, 2025. Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, NY Times, ABC News, and NBC News, describe official releases of photos, video, and rifle details by the FBI and law enforcement on September 11, but none attribute an exclusive gun photo to the New York Post. An FBI press conference occurred on September 11 (aligning with the 'two hours after' timeline if at ~7 a.m. MT), but the specific NY Post publication could not be located. Verification would require access to New York Post's publication archives or internal records from September 11, 2025, to confirm or refute the existence and timing of such an article.

## Follow-up
