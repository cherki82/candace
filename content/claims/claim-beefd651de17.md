### Analysis

The claim's phrase 'love letters' is a metaphorical expression used by FBI Director Kash Patel in his announcement, not literal letters, but it reflects documented praise from Comey, such as his 2014 speech to the ADL where he highlighted their partnership and training of 47,000 law enforcement officers. The 'embedded FBI agents' element is supported by reports of a formal FBI-ADL partnership under Comey involving intelligence sharing and agent training, as confirmed in multiple outlets including Fox News, Newsweek, and historical ADL-FBI collaborations; however, 'love letters' adds interpretive exaggeration.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Records of James Comey communications with ADL
