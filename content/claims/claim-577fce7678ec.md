### Analysis

No reliable sources, including news articles or official records, provide evidence that a specific plane tail number was searched on Google from Israel on September 8th, two days before Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10th. The claim appears in Candace Owens' podcast as part of broader conspiracy theories involving planes and Israel, but it lacks supporting documentation. Verification would require access to Google's private search logs or data (e.g., via subpoena or internal records), which are not publicly available. Google Trends was suggested in the transcript, but it does not offer granular, country-specific data for obscure terms like tail numbers on exact dates. Multiple searches across web and X/Twitter yielded discussions of Owens' related claims (e.g., Egyptian planes, Israel links) but no confirmation or refutation of this specific Google search allegation.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Google search data or IP logs for plane tail number from Israel September 8
