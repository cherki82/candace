### Analysis

The claim involves a private phone call between Sergio Gor and Candace Owens on February 25th (likely 2025 based on context), which is inherently difficult to verify without direct evidence from the parties involved. Web searches and X posts reference Owens' broader allegations about Brigitte Macron and related threats, but provide no independent confirmation or refutation of this specific call. Posts on X repeat similar claims (with spelling variations like 'Sergio Gore'), but these are not reliable evidence. To verify, access to phone records, call logs, or statements from Gor or the White House would be required; no such primary sources were found in available results.
