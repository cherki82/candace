### Analysis

Reliable sources, including Wikipedia (sourced from news reports) and articles from BBC, NBC, CNN, and NPR, confirm Tyler Robinson was taken into custody on the evening of September 11, 2025, after surrendering at the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Utah, facilitated by his family and a retired detective. However, no primary sources (e.g., official police statements, arrest records, or news articles) specify the exact time as around 7 p.m., mention local texts circulating at that time, or indicate he was 'picked up' in Warner Valley (sources describe a voluntary surrender, not a pickup). Posts on X suggest times like 10 p.m. or 11 p.m., but these are inconclusive and not reliable evidence. Verification would require access to official arrest logs, police reports from Washington County Sheriff's Office, or FOIA-requested documents detailing the exact timeline and location; news archives do not provide this level of specificity for the custody event.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Local reports or texts timestamps
