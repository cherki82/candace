### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, New Georgia Encyclopedia, and History.com, confirm Leo Frank was a Jewish superintendent (not owner) of the National Pencil Company in Atlanta in 1913; Mary Phagan was a 13-year-old employee who was found strangled and sexually molested in the factory basement on April 26, 1913. The claim accurately states the year, location, Phagan's age, her employment, and that she was found raped/sexually assaulted. However, Frank was not the factory owner (he managed it) and descriptions of him as 'unbelievably wealthy' are exaggerated—he was a well-connected businessman but not extraordinarily so. Posts on X reflect ongoing debates but align with historical accounts of assault.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Court records and historical accounts of Leo Frank trial and Mary Phagan murder
