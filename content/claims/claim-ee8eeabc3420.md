### Analysis

Reliable sources, including FBI updates and news reports from CNN, PBS, and AP, confirm Charlie Kirk's assassination occurred around 12:00 p.m. MT on September 10, 2025, at Utah Valley University in Provo, Utah. However, no primary sources (e.g., news articles, official statements, or flight records) mention or confirm a plane 'dip' approximately 26 minutes later. Discussions on X/Twitter reference similar suspicious flight activity (e.g., low-altitude passes around 24-30 minutes post-shooting), but these are not conclusive evidence. Verification would require public flight tracking data from sources like FlightRadar24 or ADS-B Exchange, official FAA logs, or a FOIA request for air traffic control records from Provo Airport on that date, cross-referenced with the precise assassination timestamp from court or investigative documents.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Timestamp of assassination and FlightRadar data
