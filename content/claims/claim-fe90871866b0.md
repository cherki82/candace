### Analysis

No primary sources, such as official statements from TPUSA, the FBI, or investigative reports, confirm or refute that a specific individual secured and handed over footage to federal authorities following Charlie Kirk's shooting. News articles discuss Owens' claims about unreleased FBI-held video related to the incident, but do not verify the specific conversation or action described. Verification would require access to FBI investigative records, TPUSA internal communications, or court documents from the ongoing investigation, potentially obtainable via FOIA request.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Confirm individual's actions and intentions
