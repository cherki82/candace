### Analysis

No reliable primary sources, such as news articles, official statements, or documents, confirm or refute the occurrence of a specific phone call from Charlie Kirk to Candace Owens instructing her to stop speaking about Brigitte Macron. The claim originates from Owens' podcast and is echoed in social media posts on X, but these are not conclusive evidence. Multiple searches across web results and X posts discuss Owens' broader conspiracy theories involving Kirk, the Macrons, and assassination plots, but none provide verifiable details on this private call. Verification would require access to phone records (e.g., via subpoena or FOIA request to telecom providers), text message logs shared publicly with authentication, or corroborating statements from Kirk's estate, associates, or other witnesses.
