### Analysis

Multiple news outlets, including Euronews, Jerusalem Post, and Times of India, report on Candace Owens' claims of a $1.5 million payment by Macron for assassins (one Israeli, one French-Canadian) routed through an elite club (variously reported as 'Club des Cent' or similar to 'club des Saints'), but all emphasize that no evidence or official confirmation has been provided. The claim remains unsubstantiated allegations amid a defamation lawsuit. Verification would require access to French government financial records, bank transfer documents, or investigative reports from authorities like the FBI (to which Owens reportedly submitted claims), potentially obtainable via FOIA requests or court proceedings.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Bank transfer records from club des Saints
