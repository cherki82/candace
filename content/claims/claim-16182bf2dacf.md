### Analysis

No primary sources, such as official FAA records, FlightRadar24 data, or government statements, were found to confirm the exact details of a plane departing Biggs Army Airfield at 6:13 a.m., dipping to 300 feet over Provo airport runway, and making a loop on September 10, 2025. Posts on X describe a similar military-related plane descending to around 200 feet over Provo on that date, but these are inconclusive and do not match the exact altitude or confirm the departure details. Verification would require access to official flight logs from the FAA, military records via FOIA request, or detailed tracking data from services like FlightRadar24 for the specific aircraft.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** FlightRadar data or FAA records for plane from Biggs Army Airfield on September 10, 2025
