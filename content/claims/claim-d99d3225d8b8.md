### Analysis

A September 2025 news article from the Lincoln Journal Star reports that Turning Point USA planned to establish a chapter at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2024, but those plans were put on hold due to a protest that escalated into a political crisis. The university was only prepared to recognize the chapter in 2025 after securing a faculty adviser. This directly contradicts the claim of starting a chapter on February 11, 2024. No reliable sources, including official TPUSA announcements or news reports, were found confirming a chapter start on that specific date in 2024, though an earlier chapter formation was reported in 2018.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** TPUSA Instagram or chapter announcements for University of Nebraska Lincoln February 2024
