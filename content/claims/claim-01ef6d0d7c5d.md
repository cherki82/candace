### Analysis

No primary sources, such as official medical examiner reports, court documents, or statements from investigators, publicly confirm or refute whether Erika Kirk has seen the autopsy report or specific evidence portions in the Charlie Kirk assassination case. An autopsy is standard for homicides under Utah law, and evidence like DNA matches and shell casings has been reported in news outlets, but details of family access are not disclosed. The claim originates from Erika Kirk's own statement in a Jesse Watters interview, as noted in social media and news discussions. Verification would require FOIA requests for medical examiner records, court filings from the prosecution against Tyler Robinson, or official statements confirming what evidence was shared with the family.
