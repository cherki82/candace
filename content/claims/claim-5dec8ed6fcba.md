### Analysis

The claim refers to alleged private messages from Charlie Kirk to Candace Owens on April 6, 2018, expressing a premonition of his death. No primary sources, such as the actual messages, news articles, or official statements from Turning Point USA, were found to confirm or refute this. Searches on the web and X (formerly Twitter) for references to these messages, premonitions, or dreams yielded no supporting evidence. Verification would require access to Kirk's private communications (e.g., via subpoena or release by TPUSA officials like Mikey McCoy) or independent corroboration from involved parties. The cited Wikipedia page on Kirk's 2025 assassination provides context on his life and death but does not mention any 2018 premonitions.
