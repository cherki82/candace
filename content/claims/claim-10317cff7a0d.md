### Analysis

No primary sources such as official property records, news articles from established outlets, or statements from the ADL or FBI were found to confirm or refute the claim of shared office space in Connecticut. The claim appears to originate from social media posts on X, which cite unspecified property records but do not provide them. Web searches yielded results about the FBI cutting ties with the ADL in 2025, but nothing on shared spaces. To verify, access to official Connecticut property records, ADL/FBI office directories, or a FOIA request for federal building occupancy details would be required. X posts are inconclusive and cannot serve as reliable evidence.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Property records for ADL and FBI offices in Connecticut
