### Analysis

No reliable primary sources (e.g., news articles from established outlets like Yahoo News, Daily Mail, or official FBI statements) confirm or refute the specific claim that airport personnel were instructed to lie about the N888KG flight. Web searches and X posts discuss conspiracy theories around the flight but provide no evidence of such instructions; they focus on the jet's departure and transponder issues. The claim appears based on hearsay from the podcast. Verification would require internal airport or federal documents, such as FAA records, flight manifests, or FOIA requests for communications directing personnel to withhold or falsify information.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Witness statements from airport personnel
