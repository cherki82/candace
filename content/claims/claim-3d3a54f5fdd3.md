### Analysis

No reliable sources, including news articles from established outlets (e.g., BBC as mentioned in the transcript), official statements, or public records, were found mentioning a Sherry Steele as a resident of any building complex in Orem, Utah, in connection with the Charlie Kirk shooting. Multiple search strategies across web results and X posts yielded no evidence of her existence, footage, or involvement. Verification would require access to private resident databases, property records from Utah County, voter registration logs, or FOIA requests for police reports and witness statements related to the incident. The absence of any public documentation for a purported witness in a high-profile assassination suggests the claim cannot be confirmed or refuted without these restricted sources.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Public records search for Sherry Steele in relevant location
