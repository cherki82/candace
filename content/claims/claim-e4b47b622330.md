### Analysis

The claim refers to a private phone conversation on September 10th, when Charlie Kirk was in the hospital after being shot, where Andrew Kolvet allegedly warned Candace Owens about a 'list' including her and Tucker Carlson, advising them to lay low. News sources, including this article, report Owens publicly questioning Kolvet about issuing such a warning after Kirk's death, but they do not provide independent evidence confirming the conversation occurred or its content. X posts and other web results confirm the date of Kirk's hospitalization and shooting as September 10th, but offer no corroboration of the specific warning. Verification would require statements from Kolvet, call logs, or other direct evidence of the interaction, which are not publicly available.
