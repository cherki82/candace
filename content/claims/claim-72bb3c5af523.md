### Analysis

No reliable primary sources such as news articles, official statements, or government documents were found confirming that President Trump made an announcement at exactly 6 a.m. on September 12 about a suspect being in custody with a high degree of certainty. Posts on X from that date quote similar statements attributed to Trump on Fox & Friends, but X posts are inconclusive and cannot serve as factual evidence on their own. The claim mixes a specific time (6 a.m.) with a verifiable public appearance format (Fox & Friends, which airs starting at 6 a.m. ET), but without transcripts, video footage, or reports from established outlets like Fox News, CNN, or the White House, it remains unverifiable. Verification would require access to official Fox News archives, White House press releases, or contemporaneous news reports from September 12, 2025.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Fox & Friends interview transcript
