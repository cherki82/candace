### Analysis

Multiple reliable news sources, including PBS, NBC, CBS, BBC, NPR, ABC, and CNBC, report on Governor Cox's statements and interviews following the Charlie Kirk shooting, focusing on a single suspect in custody with no mention of a second suspect or any description of dark clothing. One source explicitly notes authorities' confidence that the suspect acted alone, contradicting the claim of a second suspect being mentioned in any press conference.
