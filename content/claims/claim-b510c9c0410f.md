### Analysis

No reliable sources confirm the specific claim of receiving a cease-and-desist letter on December 3, 2024, as the first ever from Brigitte Macron and her lawyers. Available web results and X posts reference a defamation lawsuit filed in July 2025 and mention prior requests for retractions or a cease-and-desist in the case file, but none specify the December 3, 2024 date or confirm it as the first. Recent articles report on Owens' broader claims but do not independently verify this detail. To verify, access to the full lawsuit documents detailing dates of any cease-and-desist letters, or a copy of the letter itself with timestamp, would be required.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Legal correspondence records
