### Analysis

Multiple news articles, including from National File and Internewscast Journal, report that video footage from the September 10th incident directly contradicts Pastor Rob McCoy's account. The video shows Mikey McCoy turning and walking away less than a second after the shot, on his phone, without any blood on him or checking on Charlie Kirk, refuting the claim of an immediate call to his father describing the shooting in the neck and requesting prayers. Posts on X further highlight this timeline discrepancy, with sources agreeing the pastor's version is inaccurate.
