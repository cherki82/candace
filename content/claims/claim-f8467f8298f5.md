### Analysis

Reliable sources, including Turning Point USA's official Faith website and posts on X, confirm a TPUSA Faith Pastors Summit occurred in Nashville in 2023, but the date was May 24-26, not March 24. Additionally, an official page for a 2022 summit (tpusafaith.com/summit22/) indicates the 2023 event was not the first-ever, contradicting that part of the claim. The Nashville location is accurate.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** TPUSA event calendar March 2023
