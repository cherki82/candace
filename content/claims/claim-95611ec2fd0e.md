Ex-TPUSA Member Pushes ‘Egyptian Air Force’ Theory | US News - Times Now](https://www.timesnownews.com/world/us/us-news/who-does-candace-owens-think-killed-charlie-kirk-ex-tpusa-member-pushes-egyptian-air-force-theory-article-152989540)

### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including this article from Times Now and others like Yahoo News, refute the claim by noting it stems from Candace Owens' conspiracy theory undermined by errors such as time zone confusion (mistaking UTC for Utah time). Official investigations from the FBI and prosecutors attribute the assassination solely to Tyler James Robinson acting alone, with no mention of Egyptian military involvement in primary sources like Wikipedia, PBS News, or FBI updates. No evidence from established news outlets or government statements supports the presence of Egyptian military men in Utah on September 10, 2025.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Flight manifests or official records from Provo airport on September 10, 2025
