### Analysis

No reliable primary sources, such as official FBI statements, Utah government documents, or established news outlets (e.g., CNN, PBS, NPR), confirm or mention any FBI pressure on Utah authorities to rule the assassination as a lone gunman act or to close the case. Official reports and news articles describe the incident as perpetrated by a single suspect, Tyler James Robinson, who was charged with aggravated murder, with authorities expressing confidence he acted alone (e.g., statements from Utah Gov. Spencer Cox). The claim originates from an anonymous 'authoritative source' in the podcast, which mixes verifiable facts (e.g., the suspect's name and charges) with unverified interpretation of motives. To verify, access to internal FBI or Utah law enforcement communications, such as emails or memos via FOIA requests, or public statements from involved officials would be needed. Posts on X reflect public sentiment and conspiracy speculation but do not provide conclusive evidence.
