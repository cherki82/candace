### Analysis

The claim is a personal anecdote from Rob O'Neill based on his combat experiences, stating that shirts did not move in a particular way when he shot people. No primary sources, such as news articles, official forensic analyses, or expert statements, were found that directly support or refute this subjective observation. Multiple search strategies (e.g., queries on ballistics, gunshot wound analysis, shirt movement in shootings, and Rob O'Neill's comments on the Brian Thompson assassination) yielded no reliable evidence addressing this specific detail. To verify, access to classified military records, videos from O'Neill's operations, or independent ballistic experiments replicating similar conditions (e.g., clothing response to specific calibers and velocities) would be required, potentially via FOIA requests to the Department of Defense or expert forensic reconstructions.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Ballistic review of shirt movement in video
