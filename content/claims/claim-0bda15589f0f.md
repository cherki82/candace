### Analysis

No reliable sources (such as FAA registry, news articles, or official statements) were found confirming or refuting that the specific plane mentioned (which dipped low over Provo Airport) is owned by Lasai LLC. The claim originates from Candace Owens herself, but independent verification is lacking. To verify, access to FAA aircraft registration records, FlightRadar24 data linked to ownership, or a FOIA request for detailed flight logs would be required. Searches on the web and X yielded discussions of related planes (e.g., Egyptian jets or other private jets in Provo) but no direct evidence on Lasai LLC ownership.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** FAA aircraft registration records for tail number
