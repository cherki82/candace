### Analysis

News articles from reliable outlets like The Salt Lake Tribune and Fox News report that Brian Harpole texted or raised concerns with UVU Police Chief Jeff Long about rooftop security, implying the communication was Harpole's. However, posts on X (formerly Twitter) claim the text exchange was actually between Dan Flood (a Turning Point USA security member) and Chief Long, aligning with the podcast claim. There are no primary sources, such as the actual text messages, screenshots with sender details, or official statements from Harpole, Flood, or Long, to confirm who sent the messages. Discrepancies between news reports and social media sentiment make it impossible to verify without access to the original texts or confirming documents, which could be obtained via FOIA requests to UVU or police records.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Original text messages between Dan Flood and Chief Long
