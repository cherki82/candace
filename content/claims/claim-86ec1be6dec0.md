### Analysis

The Jerusalem Post article reports on leaked messages from Candace Owens showing Charlie Kirk criticizing donors after losing a $2 million donation, directly supporting the claim's core elements. Additional web sources, including a Pravda EN article quoting Tucker Carlson, confirm the specific detail of the loss occurring two days before Kirk's death due to the pledge to feature Carlson at the Turning Point conference. Social media posts on X further corroborate this with references to a specific donor (Robert J. Shillman) withdrawing a $2 million pledge, though these are secondary and based on the same leaks and statements. No contradicting evidence was found in reliable sources.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Donor records or Turning Point financials
