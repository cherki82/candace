### Analysis

The claim relies on anonymous emails from locals to Candace Owens alleging federal pressure not to share footage. News sources report on Owens' statements about missing or suppressed footage in the Charlie Kirk case, including FBI denials of requests for surveillance video, but no primary evidence (e.g., official statements, documents, or direct accounts from locals) independently confirms or refutes that federal agents specifically instructed locals not to share footage. Verification would require public statements from the locals, FBI internal communications obtained via FOIA, or investigative journalism corroborating the interactions.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Local reports or statements from Orem/UVU residents
