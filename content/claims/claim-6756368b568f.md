### Analysis

No reliable sources, such as news articles or flight tracking records, were found to support or refute the claim that a plane with tail number SUBTT (likely referring to an Egyptian-registered aircraft, possibly SU-BTT) was in Utah in 2023 at the same time as Charlie Kirk or a Turning Point USA event. Available web results and X posts focus on conspiracy theories related to a 2025 Egyptian Air Force plane sighting in Utah but do not address 2023. Verification would require historical flight logs from databases like FlightAware or ADS-B Exchange for the specific tail number, cross-referenced with news reports or official schedules of Charlie Kirk's appearances in Utah in 2023.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Check FlightRadar24 data for SUBTT in Utah 2023 coinciding with Charlie Kirk's location
