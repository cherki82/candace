### Analysis

No reliable external sources, such as news articles from established outlets (e.g., The Times of India, Daily Mail, USA Today) or official statements, confirm or refute the specific claim of Charlie Kirk contacting Candace Owens on February 24, 2025, to relay a White House request to stop discussing Brigitte Macron. The claim involves a private communication, and while Owens has made public allegations about related conspiracies involving Macron, Kirk's death, and assassination attempts (as noted in Wikipedia and other news sources), this particular interaction is not independently documented. Verification would require access to private text messages, phone records, or official White House communications (e.g., via FOIA request), or corroborating statements from involved parties, which are not available in public records.
