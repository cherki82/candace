### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including Wikipedia, ABC News, Reuters, AP News, and local outlets like Lehi Free Press, confirm Charlie Kirk was rushed to and pronounced dead at Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem, Utah, following the shooting at Utah Valley University. This supports the claim that he was taken to Timpanogos, described as a smaller regional hospital. However, the claim that it was 'a little farther away' and a 'trauma III center' is mixed: posts on X and some reports suggest Utah Valley Hospital (a Level II trauma center) was closer and better equipped for severe trauma, indicating Timpanogos may indeed be farther and less equipped (potentially Level III), but official news sources do not explicitly confirm or refute the distance or exact trauma level comparison, mixing verifiable facts with interpretive elements.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Check hospital transport records or reports
