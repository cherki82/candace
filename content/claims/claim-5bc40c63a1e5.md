### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including ADL, Wikipedia, Axios, SPLC, and CNN fact-checks, confirm that conspiracy theories alleging Israel's involvement in Charlie Kirk's assassination emerged immediately after the event. These theories are described as baseless and antisemitic by established outlets, supporting Netanyahu's claim that such accusations are fabricated lies. Official denials from Netanyahu and lack of evidence for the theories further corroborate this.
