### Analysis

No reliable sources, such as news articles or official TPUSA announcements, were found confirming Candace Owens spoke at two TPUSA conferences or participated in the Live Free Tour with Charlie Kirk in 2024 ('last year' relative to the 2025 podcast date). Available sources, including Wikipedia, reference her involvement with TPUSA events in 2018 but provide no evidence for 2024. To verify, access to TPUSA's official 2024 event archives, speaker lists, video footage, or contemporaneous news reports from established outlets covering the specific conferences and tour dates would be required. The claim mixes verifiable past association with TPUSA (e.g., 2018 events) but the specific timing and details for 2024 remain unsupported.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Verify TPUSA event records and website
