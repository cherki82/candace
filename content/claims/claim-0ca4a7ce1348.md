### Analysis

Multiple news outlets, including Times of India, The Independent, BBC, and Deadline, report that Candace Owens claimed Trump called her in February to ask her to stop discussing Brigitte Macron. These sources confirm the general claim of a February call but do not specify the exact date of February 26th or provide independent verification (e.g., no statements from Trump or White House logs). The claim relies solely on Owens' account, with no corroborating evidence found. To verify, access to White House phone records, Trump's personal call logs, or a deposition from the ongoing Macron defamation lawsuit against Owens would be required, as these could confirm or refute the private call.
