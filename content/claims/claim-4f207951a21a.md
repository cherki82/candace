### Analysis

The claim about an Egyptian military plane (tail number SU-BND) departing Provo, Utah, three days after Charlie Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025, is contradicted by reliable news sources reporting that similar allegations by Candace Owens were debunked due to her confusion of UTC with local Utah time. No primary sources, such as FAA flight records or official statements, confirm any Egyptian military planes departing Provo around that date; instead, reports treat these as unsubstantiated conspiracy theories facing backlash. Verification would require access to official FAA or FlightAware flight logs for September 13, 2025, at Provo Airport (PVU).

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** FlightRadar24 data for SUBND departure from Provo, Utah three days after alleged assassination
