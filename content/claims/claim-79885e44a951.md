### Analysis

Searches across web sources and X posts reveal evidence of partnerships and collaborations between Lance Wallnau and Turning Point USA (TPUSA), including joint tours like the Courage Tour and efforts to mobilize voters in swing states, but no reliable primary sources (e.g., news articles, financial disclosures, or official statements) confirm or refute Wallnau providing significant funding to TPUSA Faith operations. Claims of behind-the-scenes funding appear based on anonymous internal sources, which are inherently unverifiable without public documentation. Verification would require access to TPUSA's detailed IRS Form 990 donor schedules, audited financial statements, or confirmed disclosures from Wallnau or TPUSA officials; no such records are publicly available in searched sources.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Turning Point USA financial disclosures or insider confirmations
