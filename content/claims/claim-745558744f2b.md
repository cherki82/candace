**Type:** Factual

## Claim

> The venue was indeed secured in quick order, but that was because they had help from the White House, and Turning Point did not book that venue back in May, so we can formally debunk that. I was told that the White House stepped in and put in a personal phone call to the event coordinator. And they actually did already have an event that was scheduled. And the White House simply asked those people if they would be willing to move or reschedule their event. It was apparently supposed to be an RV show.

### Analysis

The memorial service for Charlie Kirk is well-documented as occurring at State Farm Stadium on September 21, 2025, with over 90,000 attendees and speeches from President Trump, Vice President Vance, and others. However, no reliable sources (including news articles from Fox News, CBS, PBS, NBC, USA Today, CNN, and Wikipedia) confirm or refute White House involvement in securing the venue, a personal phone call to the event coordinator, or the rescheduling of a scheduled RV show. X posts discuss rumors of a pre-booking in May but do not provide evidence for the claim's details. To verify, access to State Farm Stadium rental agreements, official White House or Turning Point USA statements on the booking process, or confirmation from RV show organizers about rescheduling would be required. No such primary evidence was found despite searching with variations on queries related to venue booking, White House involvement, and RV show rescheduling.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Turning Point USA or White House confirmation
