### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including FBI press releases, Wikipedia, and news outlets like NBC, CNN, and CBS, confirm FBI involvement in the investigation of Charlie Kirk's assassination at UVU, assisted by the Utah Department of Public Safety and ATF. However, no sources specify or mention the Connecticut field office being sent or involved. Posts on X discuss FBI agents at the scene but do not reference Connecticut. To verify this specific claim, access to internal FBI deployment records, official statements on field office assignments, or a FOIA request to the FBI for investigation team details would be required. The lack of mention in extensive coverage suggests this detail may not be publicly documented.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** FBI assignment records for UVU investigation
