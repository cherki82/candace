### Analysis

No primary sources, such as official TPUSA documents, news articles from established outlets, or university records, were found detailing the typical booking timeline for TPUSA campus events. The Wikipedia entry describes TPUSA's mission and operations but does not address event booking processes or timelines. Posts on X suggest events are usually scheduled far in advance, but these cannot be used as conclusive evidence due to potential unreliability. Verification would require access to TPUSA's internal booking records, official statements from TPUSA or university administrations, or FOIA requests for campus event approvals to confirm standard practices.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Turning Point USA event records
