### Analysis

No reliable sources, such as news articles from established outlets (e.g., ABC News, NBC News, Wikipedia) or official statements from the Orem Police Department, were found confirming or refuting that a witness named Bishop works as a records specialist there. Searches for witnesses to the Charlie Kirk assassination yielded details on other individuals (e.g., Skyler Baird) but not Bishop in this role. Verification would require access to Orem Police Department employment records, a FOIA request for personnel files, or confirmatory reporting from credible news sources linking her to the department.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Orem Police Department employment records
