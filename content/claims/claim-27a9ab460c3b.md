### Analysis

Multiple reliable news sources, including IBTimes UK, Daily Mail, and CNN, cover Candace Owens' allegations of a French state-backed plot against her, including claims involving President Macron. However, none report any official response or statement issued directly by the Élysée Palace addressing these specific claims. A separate report mentions a French Ministry dismissing related allegations over a spelling error, but this is not attributed to the Élysée Palace itself. The absence of any documented response from the Élysée Palace supports the claim that their official response is 'nothing'.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Official statements from Élysée Palace
