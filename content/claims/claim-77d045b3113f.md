### Analysis

Reliable sources including Wikipedia and Ballotpedia provide comprehensive lists of candidates who ran in the 2024 Utah gubernatorial election, including those in primaries, conventions, and the general election. Scott Robbins is mentioned in the Wikipedia article in a list that appears to be endorsers or related figures (e.g., alongside Jason Chaffetz and Robert O'Brien), but not as a candidate who declared, filed, or participated in the race. No news articles, official filings, or government records confirm he ran for governor; his absence from candidate lists contradicts the claim.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Utah election records 2024
