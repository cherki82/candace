### Analysis

The claim stems from conspiracy theories promoted by Candace Owens, with web sources and X posts echoing unverified allegations of Egyptian military subcontractors being dropped off in Provo on September 10. However, reliable news outlets report official investigations concluding the suspect acted alone, with debunkings focused on timing errors (e.g., time zone confusion). No primary sources, such as flight manifests or official passenger lists, confirm or refute the specific details about subcontractors. Verification would require access to FAA flight records, passenger manifests, or FOIA requests for aviation and investigative documents from U.S. authorities.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Confirmation from tip source or flight manifests
