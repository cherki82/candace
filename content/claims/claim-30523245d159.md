### Analysis

Multiple established news outlets, including Hindustan Times, The Economic Times, and Times of India, report on Candace Owens' claim that an Egyptian Air Force plane (tail number SU-BTT) was present in Provo, Utah, arriving on September 4th and departing on September 10th. These reports reference flight tracking data from sources like FlightRadar, with no contradictions to the dates. Debunkings focus on time zone errors regarding the exact timing on September 10th relative to the assassination, not the arrival or departure dates themselves.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** FlightRadar history for tail SUBTT in September 2025
