### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including Britannica, ADL's official history page, and Wikipedia, confirm that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was founded in 1913 by the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith, a Jewish service organization, initially as the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. This supports the claim that the ADL was 'born out of' B'nai B'rith, which is Jewish. However, while B'nai B'rith was founded in 1843 with a fraternal structure inspired by Freemasonry and some founders were Freemasons, it is not officially a Freemason organization but rather an independent Jewish fraternal group. The 'Freemason' label is an interpretive exaggeration not directly supported by primary sources like official histories or encyclopedias, which describe it as a Jewish service or fraternal organization.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Historical records of ADL founding and relation to B'nai B'rith
