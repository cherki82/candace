### Analysis

Available news articles and X posts report on Candace Owens' claims about an Egyptian military plane (tail number SU-BTT) being in Provo, Utah, on September 10, 2025, with a prior trip to the US in July 2025. However, the specific assertion of 'only twice in the past year' prior to the September trip conflicts with initial reports (e.g., her own post claiming it was the 'first trip ever' in July) and later escalations in conspiracy theories mentioning multiple planes and up to 73 overlapping flights. No primary sources like official flight logs confirm the exact number of visits. Verification would require access to comprehensive flight records from sources such as FlightRadar24, FAA databases, or military aviation authorities, potentially obtainable via FOIA requests for international military flight details.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** FlightRadar history for SUBTT over past year prior to September 2025
