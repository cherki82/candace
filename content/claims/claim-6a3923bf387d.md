### Analysis

Reliable sources, including the Daily Mail article and posts on X, confirm that Kash Patel fired the chief of the Utah FBI bureau (Mehtab Syed, a woman) in August 2025, a month before the Charlie Kirk assassination in September. Multiple news outlets and X posts support the firing and gutting of Utah FBI leadership. However, no sources mention the replacement being specifically Robert Bowles, making that part of the claim unverifiable without official FBI personnel records or announcements (e.g., via FOIA request or FBI press releases).

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Check Daily Mail article or FBI announcements
