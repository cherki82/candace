### Analysis

Multiple news sources, including Latin Times, People, US Weekly, and Daily Mail, confirm that a private jet (tail number N888KG) owned by Derek Maxfield departed from Provo Airport shortly after the Charlie Kirk shooting on September 10, 2025, and later disappeared from tracking. However, none provide the exact departure time of 1:20 p.m. local time. Posts on X suggest times around 1:11-1:12 p.m. MDT (based on UTC conversions from flight tracking data), but these are inconclusive as X posts may contain unverified claims, especially for controversial topics. To verify the precise time, official flight logs from the FAA, Flightradar24, or airport records would be required, potentially via a FOIA request.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** FlightRadar or FAA records for N888KG on September 10, 2025
