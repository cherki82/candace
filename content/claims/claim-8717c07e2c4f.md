### Analysis

No reliable sources confirm the exact date of February 27th (likely 2023 based on context) for Sean Feucht's announcement as a Turning Point USA Faith contributor. Available sources discuss a partnership for the 'Kingdom to the Capitol' tour launching in March 2023, but do not specify an announcement on February 27th. To verify, an official TPUSA press release, social media post, or news article dated February 27, 2023, would be required; further searches with varied queries (e.g., exact date archives) yielded no such evidence.

## Follow-up
