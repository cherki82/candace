### Analysis

No reliable sources confirm or refute the existence of a specific text message from Charlie Kirk to Candace Owens dated May 22, 2025, with the described content about free speech censorship. While Turning Point USA has confirmed the authenticity of other leaked messages from Kirk regarding Israel-related pressures (from two days before his death), this particular May 22 exchange is not mentioned in any news articles, official statements, or verified documents. Verification would require access to original message screenshots, the full podcast episode for visual confirmation, or direct statements from Turning Point USA or other involved parties addressing this specific date and content.
