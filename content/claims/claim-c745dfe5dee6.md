### Analysis

No reliable primary sources, such as official police reports, news articles from established outlets, or property records, confirm or refute the claim of a mysteriously vacant university-owned home next to the gun's recovery site. Web searches and X posts mention the gun being found 'in the woods' or at a 'drop point' near Utah Valley University, with some unverified social media speculation about a chicken coop, but nothing addresses a adjacent university-owned vacant home. Verification would require access to official investigative documents (e.g., Washington County Sheriff's Office reports), property ownership records from local assessor's office or university disclosures, or FOIA requests for detailed crime scene maps.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Property records for university-owned vacant home near gun site
