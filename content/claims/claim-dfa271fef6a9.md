Multiple news sources and posts on X report that Tyler Robinson confessed or implied involvement to family members, leading to his surrender, as detailed in official affidavits and statements from Utah authorities. While he has not confessed to authorities directly and is not cooperating, the claim that he has not confessed 'to anything' is contradicted by these accounts of confessions to family.

## Follow-up
