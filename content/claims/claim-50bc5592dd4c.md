### Analysis

The part of the claim stating that 920 King Street houses the DEA, FBI, and Secret Service is supported by reliable government sources: the FBI Wilmington Resident Agency is located at 920 N. King Street, Wilmington, DE, and cross-references confirm DEA and Secret Service offices share the same address in official directories. However, no primary sources (e.g., news articles, official flight records, or government statements) were found confirming an Egyptian plane with tail number SUBTT (likely SU-BTT) landing in a federally monitored hangar in Wilmington, Delaware, or a foreign dignitary being discreetly moved from there to 920 King Street. Posts on X and podcast transcripts discuss these elements as part of conspiracy theories, but they are not conclusive evidence. Verification would require access to FAA flight logs, ADS-B tracking data from sites like FlightRadar24, or FOIA requests for federal agency records on diplomatic movements and hangar activities.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Flight tracking data and building occupancy records
