Candace Owens shares chilling texts: ‘I might get wiped out' | Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/charlie-kirk-predicted-his-own-death-before-murder-candace-owens-shares-chilling-texts-i-might-get-wiped-out-101761613365981.html)

### Analysis

Multiple news outlets, including Hindustan Times, report that Candace Owens shared text messages from Charlie Kirk containing similar language about predicting his death and not living to see the end of the revolution, which aligns with parts of the transcript. However, the specific claim quote is from alleged private messages, and no primary evidence (e.g., screenshots, official statements from Turning Point USA, or independent verification) confirms authenticity. Verification would require access to Charlie Kirk's message archives, confirmation from Mikey McCoy (mentioned in the transcript), or a statement from Turning Point USA validating the texts. Ongoing disputes between Owens and TPUSA add uncertainty, but no direct refutation or confirmation of this exact phrase was found.
