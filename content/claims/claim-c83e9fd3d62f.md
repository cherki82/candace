### Analysis

No reliable primary sources, such as official autopsy reports, medical examiner statements, or ballistics analyses from government or law enforcement agencies, were found to confirm or refute the specifics of the wound (entry vs. exit) or the exact moment of death relative to hitting the ground. Available news articles from outlets like The New York Times provide timelines and maps of the shooting but lack forensic details. Posts on X discuss conflicting claims about entry/exit wounds but are not conclusive evidence. Verification would require access to the official autopsy report from the Utah medical examiner's office, ballistics reports from the FBI or local law enforcement, or declassified investigative documents via FOIA request.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Forensic analysis of shooting video
