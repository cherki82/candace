### Analysis

Multiple reliable news outlets (e.g., France 24, Euronews, Daily Mail) report on Owens' public claim of being contacted by a high-ranking French government employee on or around November 20, 2025, but emphasize that no evidence has been provided to support the contact or the alleged information shared. French media and officials have dismissed the broader assassination plot as false or unsubstantiated. The claim of the contact itself is a personal assertion without independent verification, such as communication records or whistleblower confirmation. Verification would require access to private communications (e.g., emails, messages), a public statement from the alleged employee, or results from an official investigation (e.g., via French or U.S. intelligence agencies).

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Verification via French government employee identity or records
