## Claim

> on Caldera's website, they noted that they have worked in Israel. They have a map that they note every country that they have done engineering projects in. And one of them, or two dots, are in Israel.

### Analysis

Searches of Caldera Engineering's website (calderaengineering.com) and related pages do not reveal any map showing engineering projects by country, nor any mention of work in Israel or dots representing projects there. Multiple site pages, including About Us, History, and Engineering sections, were reviewed with no reference to Israel or such a map. Additional searches for variations like project maps or international collaborations also yielded no supporting evidence, contradicting the claim.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Check Caldera Engineering website project map
