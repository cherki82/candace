### Analysis

No reliable primary sources, such as news articles, official documents, or government records, were found to confirm or refute the claim that virtually everyone on a specific block in Orem, Utah, works for Caldera Engineering or that the Steeles are a big family in Orem. The company's website and related business profiles confirm Caldera Engineering exists in nearby Provo, Utah, and manufactures valves, but provide no details on employee residences or family connections. X posts echo similar rumors but are not reliable evidence. Verification would require access to property records from Utah County assessor's office, Caldera Engineering's employee directories, or local census data via FOIA requests to confirm neighborhood employment patterns and family prominence.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Employment records or local confirmation for Caldera Engineering and Steele family
