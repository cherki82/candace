### Analysis

No primary sources, such as official FBI statements or documents, confirm the existence of footage showing a woman with the shooter (Tyler Robinson) or any suppression by the FBI. Established news outlets like BBC, CBS, CNN, and The Guardian report on the shooting investigation, suspect details, evidence (e.g., DNA, confessions), and motives but do not mention any such footage or woman. The claim originates from Candace Owens' podcast and social media posts on X, with one news article (The Economic Times) reporting her allegation without independent verification. To verify, access to the alleged door cam footage, FBI investigative records (via FOIA request), or confirmation from multiple reliable outlets that have reviewed the evidence would be needed. The lack of corroboration in official or major news sources for this high-profile case suggests it remains an unsubstantiated claim.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** FBI release of footage or acknowledgment
