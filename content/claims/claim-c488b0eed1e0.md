### Analysis

The claim originates from the podcast's own analysis of slowed-down video footage, stating exactly 834 milliseconds between the shot sound and Mikey McCoy raising his phone. No independent reliable sources (e.g., news articles from established outlets like Daily Mail or Wikipedia entries) confirm or refute this precise measurement. Posts on X repeat similar timings (e.g., 0.8 seconds) but vary (some claim before the shot) and are not conclusive evidence. To verify, access to the original high-resolution video footage of the September 10, 2025, event and precise audio-visual timing tools would be required for independent measurement.
