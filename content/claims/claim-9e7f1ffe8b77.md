### Analysis

Multiple reliable news sources, including the Salt Lake Tribune (published approximately 4.5 hours after the shooting), The Hill, BBC, and others, report on George Zinn's arrest and role, with publication times starting several hours post-shooting (shooting at 12:23 p.m. MT on September 10, 2025). No primary sources, such as official Utah police statements or news reports, indicate an announcement 30 minutes after the shooting; official details emerged later, contradicting the claim's timeline.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Check police announcements on Sep 10
