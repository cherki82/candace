### Analysis

No reliable sources were found confirming the exact date or time of the neighbor interview clip referenced in the claim. TMZ published the footage of the person of interest on September 11, 2025, in the evening (22:38), which is the day after the assassination on September 10, 2025. If the interview clip was indeed from the morning of September 11, the claim that TMZ had already publicized the footage by then would be false, but without confirmation of the clip's timing, the claim cannot be verified. Verification would require access to the original news broadcast or article containing the Samuel Steele interview, including its publication or air date.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** TMZ publication timestamp vs. Erwin Steele interview date
