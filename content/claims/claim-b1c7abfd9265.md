### Analysis

No reliable primary sources, such as news articles from established outlets or official statements from Turning Point USA, confirm the existence of text messages from Charlie Kirk sent the day before his death (September 9, 2025) explicitly stating that 'they' were going to kill him tomorrow, sent to TPUSA staff and security guards. Available reports discuss other leaked texts (e.g., about Israel positions 48 hours prior or prophecies from years earlier), but none match this specific claim. Posts on X echo Candace Owens' assertions but are inconclusive and not factual evidence. Verification would require release of the alleged private text messages, court documents from the ongoing Utah prosecution, or a FOIA request for FBI investigative records related to Kirk's assassination on September 10, 2025.
