### Analysis

Available news articles and X posts confirm Candace Owens parted ways with the Daily Wire in late March 2024, with the public announcement on March 22, 2024, but no reliable sources specify an exact firing date of March 19, 2024, or confirm the Brigitte Macron episode aired precisely on March 13, 2024. One X post incorrectly suggests the episode was in March 2023, but most sources align with a March 2024 timeline for both events without exact dates. Verification would require access to internal Daily Wire employment records, official podcast publication logs, or timestamped episode archives from the Candace Owens Show.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Episode release date and Daily Wire firing announcement
