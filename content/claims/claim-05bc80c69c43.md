### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including reports from The Grayzone and ADL's own communications, confirm that in November 2022, the ADL issued a statement defending the Azov Battalion, stating it had been reformed after integration into the Ukrainian National Guard and no longer exhibited far-right influences. This change in stance effectively removes it from being classified as a hate or far-right group by the ADL, supporting the claim of removal from their 'hate list' (referring to tracked extremist entities).

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** ADL hate list archives for Azov Battalion
