### Analysis

Multiple reliable sources, including Miami Herald, Miami New Times, The Independent, and Christian Post, confirm that Bob Coy, founder of Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale (which originated in Pompano Beach, Florida), was accused in 2017 of molesting a 4-year-old girl and continuing the abuse into her teens. The claim accurately describes the accusation and location but incorrectly names the pastor as 'Rob Coy' instead of 'Bob Coy'; no sources refer to a 'Rob Coy' in this context. Wikipedia and other outlets note no charges were filed, but the accusation led to his firing from a subsequent job.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** News reports on Rob Coy resignation from Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale
