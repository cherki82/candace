### Analysis

No reliable primary sources, such as news articles from established outlets (e.g., CNN, Fox News, NYT) or official statements from law enforcement, confirm the gun was found in a backyard by a chicken coop. The claim appears to originate from local rumors and conspiracy theories discussed on podcasts and social media, with some posts on X mentioning 'woods' as the recovery location instead. Multiple searches across web results yield details on the shooting and suspect's path but no specifics on a chicken coop. Verification would require access to official police reports, evidence logs, or court documents from the Utah County prosecutor's office detailing the exact gun recovery site.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Official police report on rifle recovery location
