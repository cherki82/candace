### Analysis

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was founded in October 1913 by B'nai B'rith, and its announcement by Adolf Kraus explicitly mentioned the Leo Frank case as an example of anti-Semitism, supporting the claim that the organization was formed in response to his trial. However, the ADL's broader mission was to combat defamation against Jews, not solely to defend Frank personally. Regarding Frank being a 'pedophile and a murderer,' he was convicted of murdering 13-year-old Mary Phagan in 1913, with allegations of sexual assault, but the conviction was for murder only (no rape charge was upheld), and his guilt remains highly disputed—many sources, including a 1986 posthumous pardon by Georgia, suggest innocence due to anti-Semitic bias in the trial and evidence pointing to another suspect (Jim Conley). Multiple reliable sources (e.g., Britannica, New Georgia Encyclopedia) confirm the ADL's founding link to the case but note debates over Frank's guilt, making the claim a mix of accurate historical context and contested interpretation.

## Follow-up
