### Analysis

Multiple searches for counts of TPUSA campus tours headlined by Candace Owens versus others (e.g., queries on joint tours with Charlie Kirk, Campus Clash series, and speaker frequencies) yielded references to specific events like the 2018 Campus Clash tour and a 2019 UVU event co-hosted with Kirk, but no comprehensive lists or comparisons of total headline appearances. News articles and X posts confirm Owens' frequent involvement in TPUSA events from 2018 to 2024, but lack quantifiable data on who headlined the most. Verification would require internal TPUSA records, such as event logs or official speaker schedules, potentially obtainable via FOIA if publicly funded elements are involved, or direct statements from TPUSA.
