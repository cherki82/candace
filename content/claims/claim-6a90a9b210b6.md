### Analysis

No primary sources, such as official statements from Turning Point USA, published text messages, or reports from established news outlets (e.g., Reuters, BBC, or The Guardian), were found confirming or refuting the existence of written communications from Charlie Kirk expressing fear for his life the day before his death on September 10, 2025, or the off-record conversations with three individuals. Social media posts discuss Candace Owens' revelations and alleged screenshots, but these are inconclusive and cannot serve as evidence. The podcast episode title suggests TPUSA confirmed related text messages, but without external verification, the claim remains unsubstantiated. To verify, would require: public confirmation from the three unnamed sources, release and authentication of the written communications (e.g., via forensic analysis or court documents), or an official TPUSA statement; alternatively, investigative reporting from reliable news sources or FOIA requests for any related law enforcement records on threats to Kirk.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Testimony from the three individuals coming forward
