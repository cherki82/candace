### Analysis

Official U.S. Air Force sources, including from Minot Air Force Base and U.S. Strategic Command, confirm that Operation Valhalla Strike was a real training exercise held at Camp Ripley, Minnesota, from August 24-29, 2025, involving personnel from the 891st Missile Security Forces Squadron at Minot AFB. This supports the claim's elements of location, Minot AFB involvement, and the name 'Operation Valhalla' (full name is 'Valhalla Strike'). However, the dates are inaccurate—the exercise ran until August 29, not August 27, and was about six days long, not 'a couple of days.' No reliable sources mention it as a 'joint exercise with civilians'; this appears to be an unsubstantiated interpretation, though some unverified social media posts on X speculate about civilian involvement. Multiple government and military news outlets corroborate the core facts but refute or omit the civilian and exact date claims.
