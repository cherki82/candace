### Analysis

The claim relies on an anonymous whistleblower cited by Candace Owens, with no publicly available primary evidence such as flight manifests, passenger lists, or official statements from the Egyptian government, FAA, or U.S. authorities confirming that military subcontractors were dropped off in Provo and did not return to Cairo. Web searches and X posts discuss the conspiracy theory but provide no verifiable documentation; articles report on Owens' allegations without independent confirmation and often highlight errors (e.g., time zone confusion). Verification would require access to confidential flight records, passenger manifests from the Egyptian Air Force, or FOIA requests to U.S. agencies like the FAA or DoD, which are not publicly available and may be classified due to the military nature of the flight.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Passenger manifests for SUBTT departure from Provo on September 10, 2025
