### Analysis

No primary sources, such as an official statement from the American Jewish Committee (AJC) or reports from established news outlets, were found confirming that the AJC called Charlie Kirk an anti-Semite and 'dangerous.' Searches yielded discussions of conspiracy theories surrounding Kirk's death and corrections to unrelated antisemitism claims about him, but nothing directly supporting this specific claim. X posts repeat similar assertions, but they are inconclusive and not reliable evidence. Verification would require an official AJC press release, archived statement on their website, or direct quotes in reputable news articles (e.g., via FOIA or AJC archives if not publicly available).

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** American Jewish Committee statement
