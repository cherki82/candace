### Analysis

The address 920 North King Street in Wilmington, Delaware, is confirmed as the location of Richards, Layton & Finger, a private law firm, based on their official website. No primary sources, such as official government directories or websites for the DEA or Secret Service, list these agencies at this address in the search results. Posts found on X suggest the agencies may be at a different location (e.g., 500 Delaware Avenue), but this information is treated as inconclusive due to the controversial nature of the topic. The claim that public directories currently show the DEA and Secret Service at this address is not supported and appears incorrect.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Public directories and agency listings for 920 N King St
