### Analysis

Wikipedia confirms that Lance Wallnau attended Valley Forge Military Academy and College (supporting the graduation from a military academy) and that his father, Carl Wallnau, was an Air Force major. However, no reliable sources, including Wikipedia or other web results, mention Carl Wallnau serving under General Patton. This part of the claim appears unverifiable based on available information; verification would require access to military service records (e.g., via FOIA request to the National Archives or Department of Defense personnel files) to confirm any WWII-era service details under Patton's command.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Biographical records or military service documents for Carl Wallnau
