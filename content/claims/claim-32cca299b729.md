**Source:** [Charlie Kirk death: Josh Hammer slams Candace Owens over 'Jewish donor' row, drops TPUSA boss's full texts | Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/charlie-kirk-death-josh-hammer-slams-candace-owens-over-jewish-donor-row-drops-tpusa-bosss-full-texts-101760037740362.html)

### Analysis

Multiple news articles, including this one from Hindustan Times, report that Josh Hammer released full text messages from a group chat involving Charlie Kirk to refute Candace Owens' claims, confirming a Zoom call or long talk the night before Kirk's death. However, no reliable sources quote or confirm any specific text from Kirk saying 'they are gonna kill me' on the same day as the Zoom call. The claim mixes verifiable elements (e.g., the existence of a night call and released texts about frustration with donors) with an unsubstantiated allegation about the 'kill me' text and its timing. To verify, access to the complete original text message screenshots, timestamps, or an official investigation report (e.g., via law enforcement or court documents) would be required, as news reports do not provide this detail.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Release of text messages from day of Zoom call
