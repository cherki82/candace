### Analysis

Multiple established news outlets, including Newsweek, Times Now, and Yahoo, report on Candace Owens' podcast claim that the Dairy Queen is about a 17-minute drive from the campus where the Charlie Kirk shooting occurred on September 10, 2025. However, these sources primarily reiterate the claim without providing independent verification of the driving time, such as map calculations or official location details. Posts found on X also mention the 17-minute drive, reflecting public sentiment around the conspiracy theory, but X posts are inconclusive for factual verification, especially on controversial topics. The claim mixes verifiable elements (e.g., existence of a photo and locations in Orem, Utah) with unconfirmed interpretation (exact driving time). To verify, access to precise addresses of the campus shooting site and the specific Dairy Queen, along with tools like Google Maps for real-time driving estimates, would be required; no such primary evidence was found in available sources.

## Follow-up

**Status:** Open
**Expected:** Mapping verification from UVU campus to Dairy Queen
