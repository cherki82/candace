What are we gonna discuss today? Well, it has been going viral. A mere minutes after Charlie Kirk is shot, there are two men that look rather mysterious. They appear, they move his chair, and they take down the camera that's directly or was directly behind his head. Why did they do that? Well, fortunately I was able to establish connection with one of those individuals and I was also able to see the footage with my own eyes. What I saw was very interesting, but what I didn't see was even more interesting. So let's jump right back into this. Welcome back to Candice. ^t-00-00-00

**[[00:00:55](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-00-55.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=55)] SPEAKER_1:** Okay, rare Friday episode, gotta do Friday episode here because this is just so important and the vultures are circulating above, man. They are definitely insisting that we stop investigating this. I should at first let you know that the Senate has voted and they have passed a bipartisan resolution to designate October 14th, which is Charlie's birthday, as Charlie Kirk Remembrance Day. And I have to say that is a very government maneuver. Like we get a Martin Luther King Day, we've got Martin Luther King Boulevard, John F. Kennedy gets a library and a national day of mourning. But you know what? You know what I was thinking? ^t-00-00-55

**[[00:01:37](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-01-37.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=97)] SPEAKER_1:** I'd like to just find out who killed them all first. That's interesting to me. Who killed them? Before we give them a library, I'd like to know who did it. I think that's the best way for us to learn. The best way for us to remember is to study, right? That's what I learned at grade school. That's what we're doing right now. We're studying this and learning everything. Let's at first address what many people have been emailing me constantly asking me, can't you gotta look into this, you gotta look into this, look at these two strange men. We're gonna refer to this as Cambergate. It is Cambergate. And I wanna say this shout out to all of the internet sleuths, the TikTokers, the YouTubers, those of you who are not playing around and you notice this because I did not in the beginning. ^t-00-01-37

**[[00:02:22](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-02-22.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=142)] SPEAKER_1:** But yes, as I said, there's an individual who is at first, in the moment just after the shooting, he's like up on the rocks near the car that Charlie gets taken away in while he's being carried away. Let's take a look at that footage actually first. Let's look at that footage. And don't worry, there's no gore in this episode. It's difficult for me to even look at that sort of footage. Take a look. You can see Charlie's there. And one of you guys caught this. You probably didn't even see it there. And we can get in a little closer. Do you guys have it slow it down or do you guys just want to circle here? ^t-00-02-22

**[[00:03:03](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-03-03.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=183)] SPEAKER_1:** Okay. Right there. Right there, an individual standing there. Again, I am just amazed at internet sleuths as I was like, wow, that is very strange. That person appears to be calmly talking into their phone. It's like a circus around them. What's he doing? Who's he speaking to? Then just a couple of minutes afterward, that same individual appears alongside another individual And he moves Charlie's chair. That's a crime scene. That's not good. ^t-00-03-03

**[[00:03:45](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-03-45.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=225)] SPEAKER_1:** And he moves it because he wants to stand on it as he takes down the cameras or the camera, rather, that is just above Charlie's head. That's the camera that I'm talking about on the right-hand side. That's a camera that I'm referring to. And we are going to now take a look at him, and he is also the individual, as many of you pointed out, that was near Charlie or just before the assassination. But let's check out that footage of him in the immediate aftermath kind of switching around the cameras, the two of them. ^t-00-03-45

**[[00:04:20](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-04-20.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=260)] SPEAKER_1:** Take a look. Safety team is here. I just heard them say the active shooter Charlie Kirk has been shot Charlie Kirk got hit is what the security detail just said ^t-00-04-20

**[[00:05:13](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-05-13.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=313)] SPEAKER_1:** Don't worry guys, we're gonna get closer. This is just a wide shot so you can see what's going on here and then we'll get a bit closer. I know you guys have pulled apart this footage a million ways and thank you for that. And here's the closer version of that. You can see, slowed down here, he pulls out the chair, he stands on it, and yes, that would be a big no-no for a crime scene. You don't move anything. He takes down the camera that is directly above where Charlie was sitting and would be able to provide ^t-00-05-13

**[[00:05:49](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-05-49.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=349)] SPEAKER_1:** Therefore a lot of insight and then you can see he kind of sits the camera onto the desk and it looks like he removes the SIM card from it or the SD card, if you will, which we're watching right here. So I'm going, I'm going when I saw this footage. Who is that? Like, actually, I should be able to figure this out, because I've got a pretty big network at Turning Point USA. I'm the person who's wearing shades. I'm not recognizing the individual. ^t-00-05-49

**[[00:06:33](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-06-33.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=393)] SPEAKER_1:** And I reach out to somebody on the inside, and I'm just like, who's this person? And they tell me the person's name, and I go, wait a second. And I look again, I'm like, I know this person. It's been a few years, but I know this person. This person's been around Turning Point for quite some time, for years. Like I said, back when I was working at Turning Point, early days. So I'm like, I'm just gonna reach out, obviously, I know this individual, I'm gonna reach out and I'm gonna say, hey, what's up with this? Where is this footage? Why did you do this? What were you doing up there on the rocks? What's up? Like, this is not the first thing I would do if I had just witnessed Charlie Kirk being shot. And I'll say this right now, he was extremely forthcoming. ^t-00-06-33

**[[00:07:14](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-07-14.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=434)] SPEAKER_1:** Like as soon as I reached out, I just sent a text because I still had his number and he was extremely forthcoming, immediately got onto the phone. And first and foremost, I should say, obviously he's seeing all of these clips going viral and he is fearful for his family. He doesn't have any security and people are looking, you know? And he said, look, as you can see in the footage, I was sitting right to the left or to the left of Charlie when Charlie got shot. And I instantly knew that he was not going to be OK. I instantly knew that he was dead. ^t-00-07-14

**[[00:07:53](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-07-53.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=473)] SPEAKER_1:** And I then, like, as you can see, people that are running, anybody that was in that zone ran to the back and he caught his breath, he wanted to check in with and communicate to other people that were working with and around Turning Point USA, that's why he's on his phone, communicating to them what had happened. That's what he told me. Then I asked, okay, well, what about this camera thing? Why would you grab the cameras? And he says, because the first thing that I thought is that I better secure the footage and be helpful and give that footage, hand that footage over to the feds. ^t-00-07-53

**[[00:08:33](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-08-33.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=513)] SPEAKER_1:** Well, obviously that's where things get into a pickle with me because we don't trust the feds. I'm like, no, we don't trust the Fed, so we don't got to do that. Just let me have the footage. I'm like, just send me the footage. Please let me look at it. There's a lot of conspiracies that are floating around right now. People don't know what to believe. People are doing very, what I would say, credible videos. People that certainly have the credibility are ballistics experts that are saying that what we see in the front is an exit wound, not an entry wound. I don't know one way or the other because I'm not an expert. I'm getting inundated with messages from people that hunt, people that are in the military saying that this had to come, have come from another direction. this footage could help. ^t-00-08-33

**[[00:09:18](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-09-18.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=558)] SPEAKER_1:** As if nothing else, let me help you. Let me formally debunk that by seeing this footage. Like, could you send this footage over to me? Well, he didn't want to send the footage over to me without checking with Turning Point lawyers. I said, look, technically, you own the footage. Like, you know, you and some other people own the footage. Like, let me just see the footage because why go through lawyers? Like, I just want to see the footage. And also, I asked the question, why not just release it? We've already seen the worst thing that you could possibly see from the front, right? Like the front is what is a traumatizing video. ^t-00-09-18

**[[00:09:54](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-09-54.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=594)] SPEAKER_1:** And I understand that he wants to afford his wife some protection, like this has to experience that, Erica, so many people watching the love of your life and the last second of their life, it's traumatizing. I'm traumatized by it, right? That's not my husband, the father of my children. And so, out of a loyalty to Erika. He also doesn't want to give more footage to the internet. But I said, look, I'm not going to publish it. I just want to see it. And I think you should let me see that because people trust me. They know that I'm very serious about this. I don't care about anything right now other than figuring out who killed Charlie Kirk. ^t-00-09-54

**[[00:10:36](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-10-36.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=636)] SPEAKER_1:** So in the short run, he agrees that rather than send the footage, he will get onto a FaceTime call with me and he will show me the footage on his computer. He did that and I watched the footage and I'm going to tell you what I saw. to the people specifically, the people that are in the military, people that know weapons. I'm telling you this because you might be able to add more color or more clarity here, what you would expect to see. If given the weapon that they have said did this, the bullet they have said did this, I don't know anything about any of this, so I'm just telling you what I saw, okay? First and foremost, there is nothing gory about this shot at all. ^t-00-10-36

**[[00:11:21](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-11-21.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=681)] SPEAKER_1:** And so again, I am still going to work with him to get me the footage so that I think it should be shared. There's nothing gory about this footage from the back. The thing that really stood out to me, and I just kept asking him to replay it over and over and over again, is that there's no blood. there's no blood from the back. There is no blood. So I think a lot of people were wondering whether or not that bullet pierced and went out to the back. I think I vaguely even remember, and Skylar, you can maybe live look this up, but I thought the feds were saying they were looking for a bullet at some point, which is now very alarming to me. I don't understand that. How could they have been looking for a bullet? ^t-00-11-21

**[[00:12:05](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-12-05.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=725)] SPEAKER_1:** Because if I'm not seeing, and there isn't, I'm telling you, what happens in the front is not what happens in the back at all. If I'm not seeing any blood, what are we to take from that? the only thing that could make sense if what they're saying is true and that person took the shot from the place that they are saying that individual took the shot from, it would suggest that it was inside of Charlie, right? And they would know that. The feds would have known that. So they would have communicated that they were never looking for a bullet, because remember, one shot. So I'm very confused. ^t-00-12-05

**[[00:12:47](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-12-47.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=767)] SPEAKER_1:** I'm very confused not by what I saw, but what I didn't see. Okay? That's pretty much all I can tell you right now. And I am going to try to get all of the footage. And I am again, I understand that right now he is very fearful, but I am going to continue to try to privately push him to just release it. I believe that transparency is the only way. I'm much, I think all of us would agree. I have much more trust in the people than I do in the feds. The feds are lying about everything, so they should not be the only people that have access to this. ^t-00-12-47

**[[00:13:24](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-13-24.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=804)] SPEAKER_1:** And I understand not wanting to have that relived from another angle, but given the fact that there is no gore and there is no blood from this angle, I don't see why not. And so that's what I wanted to share with you guys. I know some of you guys were insinuating, I got a lot of emails that it could have been a flechette. I had to look that up. I don't even know what that is. I was like, guys, I don't know anything. Flechette shells that something could have been a lot closer that hit him and that everything else could have been a distraction. All I can tell you is that there's no blood. That's it. There's no, there is no blood in that video. So give me your thoughts on that. ^t-00-13-24

**[[00:14:06](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-14-06.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=846)] SPEAKER_1:** Now I want to get to another tip that I received that is pretty interesting because look, as you guys know, when I began investigating this assassination at no point did I ever speculate that Any other country was involved and never speculated that Israelis were involved. So it was surprising, to say the least, that they're simply pretending that I did, pretending that I blamed Israel, pretending that I said Bibi Netanyahu killed Charlie Kirk. It is now, like I said yesterday, it feels like they are trying to get ahead of something, like they know more than we know. I don't know why you would say something or accuse somebody of saying something that they didn't. ^t-00-14-06

**[[00:14:44](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-14-44.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=884)] SPEAKER_1:** I do believe that there is very clearly, we all believe there's very clearly a government level conspiracy that is involved. There's no other way to assess those disastrous text messages, absolute disaster of a fed operation with those messages. Yesterday, I pretty casually mentioned to you guys something, that the doorbell cam footage, which TMZ happened upon somehow, was from a street upon which a ton of employees that work for Caldera Engineering live. ^t-00-14-44

**[[00:15:25](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-15-25.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=925)] SPEAKER_1:** We showed you, I think, one or two of those employees, the husband and wife I had mentioned worked for Caldera Engineering, and it is a country that purports to manufacture And I said this, I said, I know nothing about the valve industry. All I know is that every time I start investigating a government conspiracy or looking into people that are really shady like Harley Pasternak, thus far three people who I've investigated who oddly either them or their families had backgrounds working in this very niche valve and piping industry, like manufacturers of valves and pipes. Like, is everybody doing that? This is very strange. Well, many of you emailed me something that was quite surprising. ^t-00-15-25

**[[00:16:10](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-16-10.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=970)] SPEAKER_1:** Maybe I'm just ignorant, but you let me know that this is a very niche industry. And by niche, I mean that you asserted that it implies major government contracts, likely the CIA, those of you who have worked at those industries telling me that there are even certain valves that are exclusively manufactured in Israel, and that they tend to be involved in this. The government and the military tend to be involved in this. And that even, by the way, on Kaldira's website, they noted that they have worked in Israel. They have a map that they note every country that they have done engineering projects in. And one of them or two dots are in Israel. ^t-00-16-10

**[[00:16:51](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-16-51.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1011)] SPEAKER_1:** And somebody explained why the government gets involved when it comes to valves and piping. And I'm just going to read you this email because maybe there are people at home who are just as ignorant as I am about government level engineering, okay? This person wrote, hi Candice, I wanted to share some detailed information regarding valves, piping and their relevance to critical infrastructure and intelligence communities. Valves as critical infrastructure assets. Modern industrial valves are used in pipelines, water treatment plants, power plants, and chemical facilities are often automated and networked, forming part of operational technology and SCADA systems. ^t-00-16-51

**[[00:17:31](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-17-31.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1051)] SPEAKER_1:** This allows remote monitoring and control of the flow of gas, oil, water, and chemicals. Cybersecurity implications. These valves are part of systems that could be targeted for cyber attacks. Compromised valves can cause pipeline ruptures, water contamination, or industrial accidents. Because of this, intelligence and regulatory agencies, the CISA, NSA, PHMSA, FERC, monitor valve networks and may maintain trusted relationships with manufacturers and engineers to ensure security and resilience. Integration with above ground systems. Modern valve networks can also integrate with cameras, sensors, alarms, and environmental monitoring. ^t-00-17-31

**[[00:18:15](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-18-15.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1095)] SPEAKER_1:** This means that an operator could simultaneously monitor flow, view live video, and respond to alarms, which enhances both security and operational oversight. and strategic value for intelligence communities, knowledge of valve locations, models, and control systems provide insight into critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. Access to or relationships with manufacturers allows agencies to monitor, assess, and secure supply chains. remote monitoring of valves and integrated systems can support emergency response simulations and national security exercises. And then they provide us with the real world context by writing companies like Caldera Engineering in Provo, Utah, manufacture specialized industrial valves and control systems. ^t-00-18-15

**[[00:19:00](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-19-00.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1140)] SPEAKER_1:** While no public evidence currently links them to intelligence contracts, their products could theoretically be part of OT systems monitored by government agencies due to the critical nature of the infrastructure that they serve. In short, valves themselves are simple mechanical devices, but when networked and embedded in critical infrastructure, they become strategically important for monitoring security and intelligence purposes. That just sounds right to me. That, I mean, I'm telling you, every story, I'm like, what is this person? It's like, are their families in doubt? Like, I mean, I don't know anybody's family did this. I don't know. Again, like, this is the kind of stuff that, like, we don't know, no, but we know. And that hit. And I feel like there is a bigger piece of this that involves Caldera. ^t-00-19-00

**[[00:19:43](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-19-43.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1183)] SPEAKER_1:** And like I said, I perceive a government conspiracy. You'd be a fool not to see a government conspiracy here, especially with the way that I am being attacked for simply trying to investigate this. And the attacks are growing frantic. It's almost as if they all received an email from somebody who said, I don't care what you say, make it up out of thin air and do not stop attacking Candice Owens. That is the loudest, it's like an alarm went off. And everyone, people that I thought I was friends with, are coming after me with obscene lies that are just so easily fact-checked, so easily, you can debunk them in four seconds on the internet, and they're delivering it as though it's honest. We're gonna talk about that. ^t-00-19-43

**[[00:20:25](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-20-25.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1225)] SPEAKER_1:** I was even surprised, PBD, I mean, I've always been friendly with him, I've always been kind to him, I have nothing wrong to him, and he seems to be kind of, he's the one who platformed without any pushback, Eric Bowling, And I have an idea about why all that may be. I'll tell you in just a second. First, I want to remind you guys about GNOLand because what if smart contract platforms were not controlled by the elites or big tech? What if they were built by and for real builders, you know, the people? That's the question that GNOLand asked and that's why they built GNOLand. They started with Golang, which is a Language real world developers already use and they built a new platform around it. It's transparent. It's intuitive and it just makes sense. There's not some confusing system of ones and zeros. It's open source. ^t-00-20-25

**[[00:21:06](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-21-06.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1266)] SPEAKER_1:** So imagine GitHub but designed for on chain collaboration and composability. Builders actually get credit for their work and they get rewarded. So every every time that their code gets used, that's the real value. It's not likes. There's not clout, it's actual rewards. GNO Land rejected Proof of Stake, which is a system where the rich run the show. They went instead with Proof of Authority, a DAO where contributors and not bad actors or Silicon Valley actually call the shots. GNO.Land is open. It's fair and honestly, it's pretty unstoppable. So if you are a builder, a freedom lover, or just tired of rigged platforms, please check it out over at GNO.Land slash Candice. Again, that's GNO.Land slash Candice. Now I've watched too many people who I am close to be vilified for standing up for the truth. ^t-00-21-06

**[[00:21:51](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-21-51.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1311)] SPEAKER_1:** I have felt the sting of injustice myself, but I've also felt something else which is courage. I'm done playing defense. I'm not going to water down what I believe to be palatable because silence is not kindness at all. It's consent in many ways. And right now, the greatest silence is around the lives that are being ended before they take their first breath. We're going to call ourselves defenders of life that we have to act like that. That's why I'm asking you guys to join me to fight back with action with truth with love for just twenty eight dollars. That is what it costs to give a free ultrasound to a woman that's in crisis and considering an abortion. You can help her to see the life that is growing inside of her and to give her truth. that the culture won't. So don't set this out. Do not wait for permission. Be bold, be clear, be unapologetic in your pro-life stance. ^t-00-21-51

**[[00:22:34](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-22-34.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=1354)] SPEAKER_1:** Go to preborn.org slash Candice right now. Give $28. Give 10 times that if you can actually because this is the line and it's time to stand on it. We must stand for truth and what is right. We must save lives from abortion and stand firm in the gospel. Again, That is preborn.org slash Candice to provide an ultrasound for just $28. Also telling you guys about the wellness company because it is flu season, which means that it's also flu shot season. After everything that we've been through over the last five years, the number of people getting flu shots is at a record low. I'm so grateful for that. Not to mention the fact that according to the CDC's own data, the flu shot is only moderately effective at best, and that's not even accounting for vaccine injuries. There is a much better way to stay healthy. Grab a contagion emergency kit from the wellness company. ^t-00-22-34

It's like having an urgent care clinic in your own home. I have a Contagion Emergency Kit from The Wellness Company because I refuse to be trapped in line in an emergency room or to rely on expensive insurance if I catch a cold. I simply open my kit, reference the doctor, written guidebook for safe use, and I get back to life. This kit is literally a lifesaver with thousands of reviews from people just like you and me who have had the kit ready in a time of need. So head over to TWC.health.canis today and use code CANIS to save $48. Get it now before cold and flu season kicks into high gear. twc.healthslashcandice with code Candice for $48 off. ^t-00-23-17

So let's get into how weird these headlines are getting. It's very strange. And I think we know why it's happening. We obviously know why it's happening, but even the publications that are usually not so blatant, because in order to be a propaganda, you want to be effective, right? You got to like lie a little and get people to believe you, not just do things that are just so nakedly deceptive that people go, okay, why am I even reading this publication? The Daily Mail put out this headline about me. ^t-00-24-00

When did this happen? Like the lying here is actually making me uncomfortable. I told you yesterday that we received way too many emails about Charlie's memorial. All of them were asking specifically for me to confirm that I was going. Didn't feel good to me. It felt very inauthentic. I know these journalists are not my friends.

Am I being paranoid or does that seem like a little weird? Even on PBD's show, where he just gives a platform, to a guest to completely lie for two minutes straight. There is this random second where PBD, rather oddly, says something along the lines of, you don't think she's going to the funeral? Like they keep talking about this. Take a listen again. At some point her credibility, I mean, is gonna go down the tubes because she needs to bring receipts. Bill Ackman brought receipts. How long was that tweet? It's still going.

That means the heir to the TPUSA throne. She doesn't speak at the events anymore. Okay, so first and foremost, why did they all want to know if I was going to this event? I said, there is no way we are going to this event now. There's a 0% chance. First and foremost, why are you saying anybody can go to it? You just buy a ticket to the event and you're all working to try to get me to confirm that I'm going. And you're doing this as if you're trying to like push my buttons and be like, we got to make her get into her ego. So she like shows up and like posted on social media. Nope.

How's that for a memorial for Charlie Kirk? That feels like the right thing for me to do right now. I'm not going to this memorial, because it's strange. To lie like this is very strange. For context, just so you can realize how... Odd this is, I spoke at Turning Point's conference, two conferences last year. It's so easily, like I said, debunkable that you have to ask yourself why they are saying it. Here is me speaking on Turning Point USA's stage last year. And here's what I said, by the way, which got Charlie in a lot of trouble. Well, let me tell you something, America. It does feel so good to go everywhere in the world and to realize that there is awakening not just happening here. Let me tell you guys, it's happening all across the globe. ^t-00-27-30

And you know you start getting close when they start to call you names. They instantly want to suggest that there's something wrong and there's something backwards about being America first. You're starting to hear the way they're framing that now. When you say you're America first, they'll ask you, what do you mean you're America first? Do you mean that you're an isolationist? Do you believe that we shouldn't have did what we did during World War II, all these things trying to pollute it? It's not that difficult. America first, first name America, last name first. We put this country's interests before the interests of foreign countries overseas. All of them. I don't care. ^t-00-28-13

And yeah, Charlie got in trouble for the stuff that I said on stage. And then they came inward and told that I was not allowed to speak at AB Fest. The donors were making threats. But like I went on tour with Charting Point last year. It's still on their website. It's so, this is like the strangest thing. We could pull up this website, Live Free Tour, Charlie Kirk and Candice Owens. Quiet breakup? What are we, why are we doing this? It's very strange. Here's all the places that we went to last year. ^t-00-28-54

And then when you look into who's writing these articles, like Victoria Churchill, you note that she has a connection to AIPAC. So AIPAC is pushing this. Right? The answer is implied by the people who are attacking me. They are all ultra-Zionists, right? Like I said, the author of that article is an ultra-Zionist. And here she is starting off 2018 in D.C. and she's got a picture of herself, if you can scroll down, I don't know if you can see this, like sitting in the audience in APAC and she's thrilled. America, Israel. It's like all of these people are agents for a foreign country. ^t-00-29-35

He is just way too involved, concerned about Turning Point USA, the future of Turning Point USA, attacking Candace Owens. And I think something sinister is going on here. How can you not see that? I also want to say this. I have had a flood of Turning Point employees reach out to me. Maybe because he says she would have been the natural heir to Turning Point USA. I'm not trying to be the heir to Turning Point USA. I kind of like my life. I don't want to take money from donors, okay? Because they do what they did to Charlie. They're not buying. They're not donating money to charity because they view it as a charity. They do it because they want to purchase your voice. That's it. ^t-00-30-18

But what these people are telling me is a very dark story that involves these donors, sponsors, influencers, a takeover of sorts that I think was happening right under Charlie's nose. And I want to say this formally as we keep investigating this. I believe that Charlie Kirk was betrayed by people who are close to him. based on what I have seen, thus far the evidence, the quote unquote receipts that require a way deeper investigation into the apparatus, the financial apparatus at Turning Point, there was definitely some weird activity leading up to this moment happening at the organization. And I've been able to verify it. ^t-00-31-02

I've reached out to some journalists. I'm sharing the information with them. And I think we're going to discover that this was ugly, uglier than we could have ever imagined, okay? There is a fear here that we are all perceiving, a desperation almost to end the investigation. The smears are becoming radical, radical. You can't just pretend Candice hasn't spoken to Charlie Kirk in years, but they're doing it and they're trying to be convincing and shocked and putting this out. I've never stopped talking to Charlie. ^t-00-31-47

Free speech meant a lot to him, right? This message is from May. We can pull that back up, right? Charlie sent me his tweet because after the assassination of Sarah Milgram and Yaron Lechinsky in DC, People were calling for like hate speech laws and Charlie were, you know, authored a long tweet saying these were beautiful people they had their lives ahead of them, but I must push back against one thing and again, it was just the justification that this somehow meant that we had to ^t-00-32-27

So now we need to say free speech is wrong. And so I wrote back to him and I said, great tweet. And he gave prayer hands. And I said, speech censorship is coming to America. And he wrote back, as you can see, and the date here is May 22nd of this year. It totally is. Okay. Me and Megan and Tucker are not lying to you. Charlie was concerned about the speech that he felt the restrictions and inevitably this happens when you get into bed with Israel. You can't criticize them at all, as Megan said, before you start enduring threats. ^t-00-33-10

Secret from whom? Secret from whom? Something is not right. Nothing we are being told is true. And the strangest thing is that Pam Bondi, who is a complete loser and a tool, is trying to use the assassination of Charlie Kirk. to lay the groundwork for hate speech laws in America. The very thing that Charlie was fighting against. ^t-00-33-51

Well, Charlie Kirk is actually now we've got to hate speech is something exactly what he's messaging me about that he doesn't want to happen. They're trying to use his death to justify. Listen to what Pam Bondi said to Katie Miller on her podcast. Take a listen. There's free speech and then there's hate speech. No. And there is no place, especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie in our society. Do you see more law enforcement going after these groups who are using hate speech and putting cuffs on people so we show them that some action is better than no action? ^t-00-34-34

And that's across the aisle. So to be clear, that's the feds telling you that they wanna pass speech laws, which will basically just give them the full power to go after you for wrong think, okay? And they're doing it in the most disturbing way ever by going after Charlie Kirk's legacy and using his assassination to say, oh, well, now we've got to get hate speech done, which by the way, who was the person of a leader who said that he was passing laws against speech in America? That was Bibi Netanyahu. ^t-00-35-13

Okay, you can find that clip of him saying that. And now what's happening when we have an occupied administration, there's no question Trump is occupied by Zionists. Okay, he's completely impotent. He's completely powerless. He cannot say anything that goes against Israel or Bibi Netanyahu. He's letting them do whatever they want. No pushback whatsoever. It's very clear Bibi is in control and his administration is saying that. It's terrible. It's absolutely terrible, but this was the plan, okay? This was the plan. And we have to stand up to this, guys. We have to fight this tooth and nail. ^t-00-35-52

People are, as Megan said, people that are under 30 are anti-Israel. So that means the future of America is anti-Israel. So what they're going to try to do is to pass speech laws, Bolshevik speech laws. They're gonna arrest us for saying that we don't support Israel. something that Charlie was passionately against, okay? And we can show you next week clips of him hosting the debate about speech and Israel and whether or not everything was antisemitism. And he was very clear in his perception that this is going to increase antisemitism, trying to pass speech laws or leaving people antisemites for criticizing Bibi Netanyahu. It's all out there and they're lying to you. ^t-00-36-37

And I would say at some level, in a very big way, we're involved in the death of Charlie because they wanted this sort of radical way to push through laws. When something chaotic happens, we usually turn to the government. I mean, 9-11, what did we do? We gave them so much power, right? The Patriot Act. Do whatever, just keep me safe. It's like they see your emotion. They see this global emotion and they want you to just agree with them that the next step is more power for the government. And this time we're saying no. No, Pam Bondi. No, thank you. Genuinely, why are you in office? ^t-00-37-21

The same administration that was going, oh, well, the George Floyd death, radical Dems, BLM, speech loss. It was wrong when the left did it. And it's wrong now that the right is doing it, which leads me to believe that we are fighting opposite sides of the same coin. It's us versus them, the elites versus the rest of us. That's it. Everything else is a mirage. And speaking of free speech, I want to speak about Jimmy Kimmel because he has been pulled off air indefinitely over his comments in the aftermath of Charlie's assassination. So let's take a listen to what Jimmy Kimmel said on his show. ^t-00-38-01

In between the finger pointing, there was grieving. On Friday, the White House flew the flags at half staff, which got some criticism. But on a human level, you can see how hard the president is taking this. My condolences on the loss of your friend, Charlie Kirk. May I ask, sir, personally, how are you holding up over the last day and a half, sir? I think very good. And by the way, right there, you see all the trucks? They've just started construction of the new ballroom for the White House, which is something they've been trying to get, as you know, for about 150 years. And it's going to be a beauty. ^t-00-38-42

Construction. This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish. Okay, so that's what he said, whether or not you think it was a insensitive joke, okay? I don't think that that would have been the justification for saying that he now needs to donate to charity and lose his whole life. And this is what happened. He's taken off air and some people are saying, hey, Candice, they did this to us and you're not wrong, right? ^t-00-39-27

You are correct. You are right to say, yes, that absolutely did happen. But if you're not recognizing that when you just flip the coin, it's the same people that are gaining more power. I just want the attacks on free speech to stop, okay? I want the reaction, if you're angry about what Jimmy Kimmel said, is for the free markets to take him out, right? He doesn't have a show because nobody's watching him anymore because they're so disgusted by what he said. That's what I want. ^t-00-40-07

And it should be noted, by the way, that in the same monologue, he did call the murder senseless. The day that it happened, Jimmy Kimmel posted a message on Instagram, sending love to the Kirk family, to the victims of gun violence. He posted, you know, instead of the angry finger pointing, can we just for one day agree that it's horrible and monstrous to shoot another person? On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents, and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence. You wouldn't have thought that he had posted that in terms of everyone that were just like stripping them of everything. And I want to be clear, I don't like Jimmy Kimmel, right? ^t-00-40-42

The people that are constantly shouting, I don't like him at all. But I'm just recognizing that our solution to being angry at each other always seems to be let's give the government more power, right? Let's give the government more power. And that's what happened here, okay? The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Brendan Carr, jumped up and he criticized Jimmy Kimmel's remarks. He threatened federal action. against ABC affiliates who carried the show? What? Federal action if you carry the Jimmy Kimmel show? Does that seem right to you? ^t-00-41-28

Okay, we're all losing. We are all losing. You have to wake up. That's what happened. Brendan Carr of the FCC was joining Benny Johnson. And that's what he said that he absolutely wants to make sure that people are not carrying this show anymore. And that after, you know, one of the mergers that they did, I just see the same people are constantly being empowered.

I know for a fact, and I just showed you that this was Charlie's fear. The government coming in on speech. That's what's happening right now.

If not, I will see you after the war, my love. Why is that so accurate? What went wrong, FBI? What went wrong? Speak to us, let us help you. You guys are just old, like what's going on? I actually think there was a person on TikTok, I hate to not credit them, but I genuinely don't remember what handle it was, I was just scrolling through, but he suggested that what went wrong was that they did use AI and in their AI prompt, they said, ^t-00-45-00

**[[00:45:39](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-45-39.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=2739)] SPEAKER_1:** to create a conversation between 20 year olds or like a conversation between 20 year olds, but they actually wrote like, the AI understood it as like not people in their 20s, but like people in the 20s, like the 1920s. And I was like, that actually could have been what went wrong. They prompted AI and they said between people in their 20s, And actually, they wrote people in the 20s and they just went with it. And that's why you have this, hello, my love. It's so bad. It's a major blunder. It's very bad blunder, you guys. but I'm happy it happened because everything is coming undone. We're exposing everything. We're going to figure out everything. ^t-00-45-39

So yeah, that's, that's what I'm doing this weekend in Memorial of Charlie Kirk. I'm going to keep investigating every single lead until I solve his murder. What are you doing? What are you doing? Get some of your comments. Also, I want to respond to some of you guys that were emailing us about the Dairy Queen photo. You were like, this is an old photo. It could be from July. It was a poster, Superman. I'll explain to you why that poster, that picture is definitely not taken in July. First, I want to tell you guys about Pure Talk because our society works because of the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment free speech, okay? Even if I hate your speech, I want you to have it. Everyday Americans should be able to speak openly and they should be able to speak honestly about family, their traditional values without any retribution, obviously. ^t-00-46-24

**[[00:47:09](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-47-09.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=2829)] SPEAKER_1:** And that's the principle that Pure Talk proudly supports.

Why keep paying 20% or more to the banks when you could just call my friends in American financing because they have mortgage rates right now that are in the fives and they are showing people every day how to keep more of their hard-earned money in their own pocket and out of the hands of credit card companies. Right now, American financing is helping homeowners save an average of about $800 a month by using their home equity to wipe out high-interest debt and there are no upfront fees, no obligations. And it's really just a 10-minute call that you make to a salary-based mortgage consultant. There's also another kicker. If you start today, you could delay two mortgage payments, which puts even more cash in your hands right away. So don't wait. Call American Financing right now. The number's 800-795-1210. ^t-00-47-50

Or you can visit americanfinancing.net slash Owens. Again, that's americanfinancing.net slash Owens. All right, let's get into some of your comments. First, I want to tell you guys, Dairy Queen photo, some of you guys noticed that there was this old Superman poster and that Superman in the background there, that poster, you said they removed those ads back in June or July. You are correct, that's when that movie came out and that's when they were scheduled to remove those ads. But rest assured first and foremost for two reasons that that is not, definitely it's not footage from July. July, just so you guys understand, there is not a place in the world that would have the bandwidth to keep ^t-00-48-33

**[[00:49:16](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-49-16.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=2956)] SPEAKER_1:** 24-hour footage inside of their restaurant dating back months. It auto-deletes, I think, the footage at my house because we have cameras absolutely everywhere. I think it's every 48 hours, every 72 hours. I think the highest you might see that is one week. This is absolutely... By the way, how would that person have known to go back to July? Could you imagine having to scroll the footage? I think I one time saw that person in July eating something here. Let's go back and scrub like that's just that definitely did not happen. The source we had was very solid. It was very specific. And also saying that they threw away clothes in the nearby cemetery was very specific. ^t-00-49-16

**[[00:49:57](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-49-57.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=2997)] SPEAKER_1:** This person was very confident when they shared it, but also something else that lets you date it to pull back up that photo. is behind, right, their advertising available now, what that actually is, is a, and I gotta remember the name of it, it's, I don't know why I didn't write it down, it's a maple leaf blizzard thing. It's maple leaf something. That dropped, and they began using those advertisements for that drink. on August 31st. So the absolute earliest that could have been taken is August 31st. And that's if they put up that advertisement immediately. Yes, the maple cookie shake. That's what it was. They began advertising on August 31st. So it's not from July. ^t-00-49-57

**[[00:50:39](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-50-39.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=3039)] SPEAKER_1:** And like I said, I feel very confident about our source. And we are taking a look at everything. You guys have sent me so much more, by the way, which I'm going to get into this weekend in memorial of Charlie Kirk about the house next door, some weird stuff that was happening at that house, what has been advertised at that vacant house where the locals believe that's the real place that they should have went to. People are telling me a lot of stuff about CIA action at UVU, some programs that they had been running, that there's a pipeline from people at UVU to people that go and work for the CIA. So there's a lot to investigate, but I also want to be given the time to fact check everything so that we don't go after the wrong people. Again, if you have any tips, any photos, you know where to send them. ^t-00-50-39

**[[00:51:24](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-51-24.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=3084)] SPEAKER_1:** Candice, I mean, that's not right. Don't send it there. Tips at candiceowens.com. And yeah, for those of you guys who have supported this, thank you so much. Like I said yesterday and the day before, we see you in the comments fighting for us. And I will say it is a good thing they're attacking this hard. It's actually waking more people up. People are watching my show, watching them lie, debunking their lies and going, okay, why did they do that? Like, why would PBD do that? Like, we've always been friends, friendly. He was very kind to me. I've always been kind to him. Why just allow these people to lie? There's so many lies just in that one segment. It's stunning to me. Even when he says Andrew Colvett was there on the Hamptons, no, he wasn't. Andrew Colvett was definitely not there in the Hamptons. What are you lying about? Very strange. ^t-00-51-24

**[[00:52:10](/timestamps/ep-aDlhjfW6hz8/t-00-52-10.md) | [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDlhjfW6hz8&t=3130)] SPEAKER_1:** Is there, like, are you being paid to lie? Or do you actually believe those lies? I don't know. But all I know is that I'm not gonna get distracted by them. We are going to solve the murder of my friend, Charlie Kirk. And if you guys would like to support us, we are independent. As I tell you, you can sign up at our website, CandaceOwens.com. Buy yourself this. This is pretty bomb. Yep, our CIA line. This is the Candace Intelligence Agency. Some people think that it actually says, like, CIA. the decentralized intelligence agency. I love it. Our products are great. And that's a way that you can just show support and show some love. In the meantime, let's just bop some Kanye power this weekend. I'm gonna hit him up. That's what we're gonna do. I'll see you guys on Monday. ^t-00-52-10
