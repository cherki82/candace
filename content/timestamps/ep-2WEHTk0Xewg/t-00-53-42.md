## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> the individual who very quickly I think four minutes after Charlie was shot went and took the camera down and moved his chair and stood up and took the camera down literally four or five minutes after he was shot. I want to let you know I was able to figure out who that person was because I recognized one of the individuals and I've reached out to that individual And I said, you know, I've known you for a long time and I would like to see the footage. I would like to see the footage and I think the world would trust me if there's nothing weird that happened on that day and there's about four or five cameras on that day.
