## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> There's something here for everyone if you want to take the low hanging fruit and think of this as left versus right, right? So if you're like, you know, on the right, you're like, I need to blame the left. Then it's like, whoa, the trans thing is here. But if you're on the left that you need to bring blame the right. Well, dad was a die-hard MAGA. It's like, it's so fed. You know, it's just so federally written. It's amazing. So chaos right here. Anyways, I guess maybe if you're suicidal, that's what you said. Dad's been pretty diehard MAGA. And then we don't know again when these messages took place, but it all had to happen in these seven or eight hours. He says, I'm going to turn myself in willingly. One of my neighbors is here. He is deputy for the sheriff. You are all I worry about, love.
