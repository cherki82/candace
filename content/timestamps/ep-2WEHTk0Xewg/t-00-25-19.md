## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> At 11 p.m. ish, we'll tell you around 11 p.m., Lance Twiggs is brought in for questioning. Okay, and shortly thereafter, that apartment is raided. And I say overnight into the wee hours of the morning is when they first raid. Tyler Atlanta's apartment. Now, why am I really stressing this out to you? I'm stressing this point to you here. Because this would signal to you that it would be absolute BS if the feds are gonna tell us right in early the next morning that the case is closed. They would know nothing. According to Lance's family, this is when they seized his electronics. They say that he's deep on the internet web, that there's definitely gonna be something there.
