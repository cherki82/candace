## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I only wish at this tragic time of mourning, she would be the friend to Charlie Kirk that he was to her. He would never have treated Candice or her family in such a way had God forbid this tragedy been hers. A friend loves it all times and he drops a biblical proverb. Now, let me say this, okay? I hope that Charlie would have been the sort of friend that I'm being, okay? He would have never, why? Why wouldn't Charlie Kirk have investigated if I had been killed and we were being so obviously lied to? I think you're wrong. I think you're wrong. I think Charlie was a real friend and he would not have dropped it. He would not have let it go. Least of all, because he was being emotionally manipulated by a guy who curiously kept his mouth shut when BB lied.
