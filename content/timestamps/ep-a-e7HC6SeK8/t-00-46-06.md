## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The predictive model of, this is my red line, then the red line gets crossed, and people are denying it. And what happens? Christians are mass slaughtered every single time, propagandize people, Christians in the East to hate Christians in the West. And there's just less of us by the end of it. And these things tend to happen, world wars, when they want a reset because people start waking up. And so I just wanted to express that to you, that I feel that we are reaching that brink right now. And you need to prepare for that. And it feels like an almost inevitability, because wars are planned in boardrooms, okay? In boardrooms. They're gonna send you and your children and your sons, but they are not going to fight.

## Claims Made

- [interpretive] "Christians are mass slaughtered every single time... [and] Christians in the East [are] propagandized to hate Christians in the West" (claim about recurring mass slaughter and propaganda targeting Christians)
  - *Follow-up:* Review historical records of conflicts involving Christian populations, reports from human-rights organizations, and propaganda analyses to evaluate the frequency and patterns described.
- [interpretive] "Wars are planned in boardrooms... they're gonna send you and your children and your sons, but they are not going to fight" (claim that elites plan wars and avoid fighting themselves)
  - *Follow-up:* Examine declassified policy documents, meeting records, investigative reporting on war planning, and biographical accounts of decision-makers to assess how wars were planned and who bore the costs.
