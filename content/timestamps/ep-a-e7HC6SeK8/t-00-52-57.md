## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So that's the sense of dread that I have about what's happened in this country. And they are Bolsheviks, and they believe murder is their right. They hate Christians. They believe in infiltration. And we should fast. We should pray. We should hope that Charlie's vision was correct. He knew he was going to die, but also that he felt, as he intimated to me, that he had to take that option so that people would wake up, and I do think that it catalyzed an awakening here. And these are risks that I also feel, missionally.

## Claims Made

- [interpretive] "He knew he was going to die... he had to take that option so that people would wake up, and I do think that it catalyzed an awakening" (claim that Charlie chose or accepted death to catalyze public awakening and that his death did so)
  - *Follow-up:* Seek evidence in Charlie Kirk's communications expressing intent or acceptance, and assess public reaction metrics (media coverage, membership/donation changes) after his death to evaluate the claim about catalyzing an awakening.
