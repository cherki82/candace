## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Candice Owens from the eyes of a 79-year-old. Thank you. I love meeting your generation, because I do think that that was the last generation that had real values. You know, America lost its way when we decided that we would do anything for money, which is what Bibi said on camera. You know, America is something you can move very easily with money. Not this American, so there's that. And Amir writes, I voted for my taxpayer funds to go from the CIA towards the Candice Intelligence Agency for all of her investigative work, because at this point, she is one of the rare public figures that are actually fighting for truth. Sadly, I mean, I just really thought there would be more allies. And there are some. Like I said, there are some good feds. There is an underground movement that is happening.

## Claims Made

- [interpretive] That (older) generation was the last generation that had real values.
  - *Follow-up:* This is an opinion; verification would involve sociological/historical analysis comparing values across generations.
- [factual] Bibi said on camera that America would do anything for money.
  - *Follow-up:* Locate the referenced video or public statement by 'Bibi' (likely Benjamin Netanyahu) to confirm the exact quote and context.
- [factual] There are some good federal agents ('good feds') and an underground movement happening within the federal government, but not nearly enough given how much we pay in taxes.
  - *Follow-up:* Seek corroboration from whistleblower accounts, reporting, or statements by federal employees indicating an organized 'underground movement' and quantify its scale if available.
