## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> More comments from today. Meryl writes, "Careful Candace, they may be betting that you won't be available for a sit down the next few weeks. Also watch your sources, sometimes the feds plant sources with almost good information in order to humiliate their target later." Yes, I'm very aware of that, and we are very cautious about our sources, and sometimes that has happened where—and we haven't gone. Fortunately, we haven't made a public mistake, but we'll keep going. And then I'll be like, I think this is good. And then Mark will be like, I don't know about this, or Skylar, I don't know about this. And that is what takes us so much time every day, is for a small team, but we're constantly having to debate ourselves before we put something out. So thank you for that. Briley writes, "They didn't answer any of your questions. They only brought up speculations that you made throughout the series.
