## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Charlie felt that this needed to happen, and inside sources at your own company say it was because he didn't know where the money was coming from, or how quickly and where exactly the money was being evaporated to. That passes the vibe check in terms of what Doge is about, because of course Charlie could not have been establishing Doge for the last five years, because that's a very new concept as of 2025, something that Trump (Donald Trump) put into place with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, right? So, yeah, you're still being dishonest, but carry on.

## Claims Made

- [interpretive] Charlie could not have been establishing a 'Doge' department for the last five years because 'Doge' is a very new concept as of 2025 and was put into place by Donald Trump with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.
  - *Follow-up:* Clarify what 'Doge' refers to, and verify timeline and any policy or organizational actions by the named figures to confirm involvement and timing.
- [factual] Egyptian Air Force planes flew out of Provo, Utah (i.e., Egyptian planes were operating from Provo), and one such plane carried the Saudi king in 2023.
  - *Follow-up:* Check Provo Airport records, flight logs, international military flight movements, and public reporting about the Saudi king's travel and associated aircraft to corroborate these events.
