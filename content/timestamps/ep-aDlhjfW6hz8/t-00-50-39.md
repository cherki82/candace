You guys have sent me so much more, by the way, which I'm going to get into this weekend in memorial of Charlie Kirk about the house next door, some weird stuff that was happening at that house, what has been advertised at that vacant house where the locals believe that's the real place that they should have went to. People are telling me a lot of stuff about CIA action at UVU, some programs that they had been running, that there's a pipeline from people at UVU to people that go and work for the CIA. So there's a lot to investigate, but I also want to be given the time to fact check everything so that we don't go after the wrong people.
