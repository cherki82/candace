## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> I'll also remind you guys about American financing because if you have been living on credit cards just to cover groceries, gas, and bills, you know those interest rates are absolutely brutal. Why keep paying 20% or more to the banks when you could just call my friends in American financing because they have mortgage rates right now that are in the fives and they are showing people every day how to keep more of their hard-earned money in their own pocket and out of the hands of credit card companies. Right now, American financing is helping homeowners save an average of about $800 a month by using their home equity to wipe out high-interest debt and there are no upfront fees, no obligations. And it's really just a 10-minute call that you make to a salary-based mortgage consultant. There's also another kicker. If you start today, you could delay two mortgage payments, which puts even more cash in your hands right away. So don't wait. Call American Financing right now. The number's 800-795-1210.
