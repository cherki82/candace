## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Now I want to get to another tip that I received that is pretty interesting because look, as you guys know, when I began investigating this assassination at no point did I ever speculate that Any other country was involved and never speculated that Israelis were involved. So it was surprising, to say the least, that they're simply pretending that I did, pretending that I blamed Israel, pretending that I said Bibi Netanyahu killed Charlie Kirk. It is now, like I said yesterday, it feels like they are trying to get ahead of something, like they know more than we know. I don't know why you would say something or accuse somebody of saying something that they didn't.
