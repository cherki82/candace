## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> If this was a lone shooter and just a random incident because he was defending his lover, how was there a list? What was that list that was happening behind the scenes? It's almost like Tucker (Tucker Carlson) and I were being threatened from the United States military. And I should really say the global state military, because I do believe that we are run by the military and that the idea of democracy is an utter delusion. Now, OK, great. We have the email just to fact-check this because it's funny. And we should now call him Alex for the rest of our lives. Eric wrote, "Hey, man"—this was an email, by the way, to my PR— "Tell Candace (Candace Owens) I meant no harm to her. It was that Alex guy who kept at it.

## Claims Made
