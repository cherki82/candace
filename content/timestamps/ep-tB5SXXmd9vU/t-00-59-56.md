## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> The entire Trogneux backstory makes entirely no sense, saying that they were chocolatiers and things were never interrupted. They just ran this chocolatier factory from, like, the 1880s all the way through to now—not possible. Nazis did an aerial bombardment. They occupied the city of Amiens. This seems to me to be an identity that was just created and materialized for this family and that the true family is a very powerful family, and that is why they are so obsessed with protecting this absurd state secret. The whole world knows this is a dude. What are we doing here?

## Claims Made

- [interpretive] This seems to be an identity that was created and the true family is a very powerful family, which is why they are so obsessed with protecting this state secret.
  - *Follow-up:* Investigate historical records, identity documents, and any legal or archival evidence that might support claims of manufactured identity or concealed family origins.
- [factual] The whole world knows this is a dude — they are pretending it's a woman and are willing to mask down and expose themselves to keep up this pretense.
  - *Follow-up:* Verify via official identity documents, birth records, medical records (where legally accessible), and credible reporting on Jean-Michel Trogneux's gender/identity to confirm or refute the allegation.
