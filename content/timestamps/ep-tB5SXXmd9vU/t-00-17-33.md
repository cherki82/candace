## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Now, you will recall, for those of you who are following the Becoming Brigitte series, that the preferred Macron response is to never address the substance of the claims, but to instead focus on minor details that somebody may get wrong. That's how they've gone after every journalist who has covered the fact that Brigitte Macron was born a male, right? Oopsies, you messed up on this one detail and now we're gonna sue you for defamation. But not, of course, the substance, which is like, hey, you lived as a man for a very long time, and the military won't release your file, and we don't know what you were doing in the military, as Jean-Michel Trogneux. So me making a spelling error was the perfect way for them to attack the broader story, right?

## Claims Made

- [factual] The French Minister of the Armed Forces issued a statement: 'Tyler Robinson was never part of the French Foreign Legion. If he did not serve in an American military unit, he could not have trained with the French Foreign Legion.'
  - *Follow-up:* Locate the ministerial statement in official French ministry communications or press releases and confirm the exact wording and context.
