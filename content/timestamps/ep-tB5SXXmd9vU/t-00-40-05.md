## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Zelensky is coming in for a big interstate meeting and Brigitte Macron sees to it that he's also photographed with Saudi Arabia at some orchestra that Saudi Arabia is putting on. And what's interesting is that it's daytime when that photograph happens. And after that, Brigitte just falls off a cliff for six days. Brigitte's just gone for six days. And I would really like to know where Brigitte Macron was at for those six days, okay? I need to confirm that. I need internet sleuths like you have never seen before.
