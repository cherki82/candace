## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> Now, that could be a coincidence, but MG+M has many employees that are either fluent in French or are connected to France altogether. The FBI apparently has Suite 300 and MG+M has Suite 200, which I believe is exactly right below where the FBI says that they are. OK, now he gets back into the crane location, right? Because there seems to be no public record of what the actual construction project is that is happening online, except for the fact that apparently a global biopharmaceutical company called Incyte owns it, okay?

## Entities Mentioned

- [Incyte](/entities/org-incyte.md) (ORG)
  > "...arently a global biopharmaceutical company called Incyte owns it, okay? If they're using this construction site, it seems to me that they're doing it to buy..."

## Claims Made

- [factual] The Bracebridge Complex at 1100 North King Street (over 1 million sq ft) is owned by biopharmaceutical company Incyte and a May 2024 article said construction there was expected to take about a year, but construction has extended well beyond that timeline.
  - *Follow-up:* Confirm property ownership via commercial property records, Incyte press releases, and construction permit timelines or local news on the Bracebridge project.
