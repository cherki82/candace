## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> So we learned from a source that a foreign dignitary was escorted, right, from that hangar to 920 North King Street in Wilmington, Delaware, a place that we learned and confirmed had three federal agencies working together in one building. The internet can try to debunk that. They can't. Okay, the feds are not going to debunk that because it's true. And then we learned that it is also a place which houses the attorneys that are filing my paperwork in the Brigitte lawsuit. I explained this: Delaware has a particular legal stipulation that even if you have your own lawyers, you have to find lawyers that will file the paperwork in your lawsuit, okay? The rules on that vary state by state.

## Claims Made

- [factual] The attorneys filing my paperwork in the Brigitte lawsuit are in a firm across the street from 920 North King Street (Delaware requires local lawyers to file paperwork).
  - *Follow-up:* Verify by checking court filings for the lawsuit (attorney addresses), Delaware filing rules, and the physical addresses of the law firms involved.
