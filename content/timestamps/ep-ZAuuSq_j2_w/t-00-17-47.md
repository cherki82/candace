## Transcript

**SPEAKER_1:**
> We could actually officially rule out that it was President al-Sisi that was aboard the jet on September 10th because he was photographed at a meeting with the Prime Minister of Tunisia, Sarah Zafrani, and it was in Egypt. We can also rule him out as having been the individual that was in Provo back in May, because he was again photographed multiple times throughout that week in Egypt, okay. What we can however deduce is that Walid Mahmoud is therefore not the president of Egypt,

## Claims Made

- [interpretive] Walid Mahmood is not the president of Egypt but is almost certainly well-acquainted with the president of Egypt because military planes that fly presidents would not typically allow random passengers aboard.
  - *Follow-up:* Investigate Walid Mahmood's identity and any documented connections to Egyptian officials; corroborate by passenger lists or diplomatic/administrative records if accessible.
