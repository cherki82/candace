## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You know, we're always talking about biblical characters, but nobody want to address Jesus. Remember, he was betrayed. The story might be relevant. We're gonna be out here acting like it's a conspiracy. Yeah, it was a conspiracy when Judas betrayed him and it was for money. Like that might be a relevant narrative when you're out here like trying to make it seem like it's never happened in the history of the world. It has happened. And yeah, I don't know. He was denied. He was denied. Just as he said, so I want to just be clear that it is, of course, plausible.
