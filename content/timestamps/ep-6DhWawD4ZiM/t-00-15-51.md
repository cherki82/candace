## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Not a good idea, okay? It may work in PR world. You guys, I know how this, it's an obvious PR campaign. It's never been more obvious of a psychological operation. I actually wish they would put me on payroll so I could help them make these things look more organic than having every single person that has been telling us to stop asking questions all make the exact same video within four seconds of each other being like, whoa! Whoa, Erika Kirk shuts down. No, she didn't even respond to one of the conspiracies. She gave us a motion. She gave us emotion. She said, I'm a mother, I am a wife. And we never asked about whether she was mother or wife. We want to know if she is a CEO and a chairman. And a CEO and a chairman has to compromise.
