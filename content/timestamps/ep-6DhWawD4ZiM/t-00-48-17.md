## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So I was looking at the logs for that flight and the flights in question are towards the center of the screen. You can see it goes from Tucson, the transponder goes dark. That's what that that dash means there. But what really stood out to me were the call signs, which are basically the fourth column from the left. So you can see it's using RCH, which is Reach. That's a standard Air Force call sign designator. But when someone important is on the plane, it switches their call sign to SAM, which stands, as you said, for Special Air Mission, which is typically reserved for people like the vice president, cabinet secretaries, senior officials of the executive branch, congressional delegations, and other senior political leaders.
