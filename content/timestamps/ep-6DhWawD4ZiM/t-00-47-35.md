## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> When he contacted me, it was the way I told you, it went about me praying and like, and then suddenly I get this email, I speak to him and he's like so credible and just gives everything. I think we need to keep prodding this narrative of what happened and what he said that he saw. And he described it as a meeting that when the operation is being finalized, a finalization meeting, and he seems like he knows what he's speaking about. So that's what I have for you guys today. Oh wait, there's also something else about that plane. I gotta bring in Mark to mansplain it. I'll just bring you on Mark. I'm not even gonna tee you up there, just come on. Thank you. Thank you. Great introduction.
