## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> That is an incredibly personal and an incredibly intimate moment, intimate moment that you invited the public into, okay? There was no reason to do that outside of wanting to share something that was very private with the public. And now you fast forward three months removed and it's why does the public wanna know where he's buried? It doesn't work like that. You have to make a decision. I want this always to be private or I want this always to be public. That's my personal feedback there. Later on in this same interview, she launches into a strong defense of Turning Point USA employees who have just as a matter of fact told many lies, many inconsistencies, these are verifiable.
