## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**

Laughing Cats Music World writes, and thank you by the way, that's a massive donation, vital to separate flaws from race. We can criticize corrupt Jews without blanket anti-Semitism critiquing George Floyd because he died of fentanyl and the hospital isn't hating black people. Stop equating criticism of Israel, Soros, et cetera, with Jew-hating or self-hating if you're Jewish and critical of all governments, including Israel.
