## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> You get another nosy neighbor who produces evidence that in the middle of the night before she died, they saw the guy outside, the husband outside removing cameras in the front yard. But it's not evidence. Yeah, but I saw him go out in the middle. He put something in his car in the trunk. He was looking shady. That's not evidence. How dare you find that to be suspicious? More nosy neighbors start discussing and they were like, hey, we heard them. They were having actually a heated argument before she was found dead. It was, I think it was about money. All of a sudden, next thing you know, you got Ali Stuckey from the HOA. She blasts out an email and she says, it's unbiblical. It's unbiblical to gossip. Hearing an argument is not hard evidence. You have no right to discuss it. Yeah, we're the nosy neighbors.
