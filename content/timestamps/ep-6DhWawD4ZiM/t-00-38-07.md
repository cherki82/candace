## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Okay, I even said to you ahead of time. I said, I don't know military vernacular. I don't know these terms. It's like another language. And you guys are not aware of yourselves. Okay, so you critiqued me for saying E4, E3 when I should have said O6. I'm jotting down these notes. I'm having a conversation. I'm trying to fact check things. And for me, I was focusing on the timeline of where he was. I was like getting all of the proof from our military guy who was there for this meeting on September 9th and it's also on September 8th as well. And I misspeak, okay? because you guys basically speak Japanese. You don't realize you do, but you do. You speak Japanese. And I said E4, E3. And I went back and I checked my notes and actually he said, oh, sixes. Thank you.
