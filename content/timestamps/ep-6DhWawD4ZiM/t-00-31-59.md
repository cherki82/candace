## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Maybe they like did this transition too quickly and she's just like keeping her head like, no, what she's saying is turning point USA is untouchable. And it's a no from me, but you know me. I'm just out here saying what needs to be said. We'll be right back after a brief message from our sponsors. All right, you guys, when they double down on abortion, we know that we have to double down on supporting life. Through our partnership with Preborn, we can help save babies and support mothers in need. Everyday Preborn's clinics rescue hundreds of babies because when a mother sees her baby on an ultrasound, and hears that tiny heartbeat, her chance of choosing life doubles. And now, thanks to a generous match program, your gift can be doubled as well. That means twice as many ultrasounds, twice as many lives saved, and twice as many mothers that are given hope.
