## Transcript

**Tucker Carlson:**
> And when you hear Tucker Carlson say that he is confirming that that part is true, what I take from that, Tucker Carlson has been very clear. He grew up with CIA agents, okay? This is a guy who grew up in Virginia. His father, he learned after his father died, he thought he was just working with the CIA. No, his father was on the payroll of the CIA. So Tucker's friends are in the state. So you should take it as a concrete fact that there's something up with these Egyptian planes and they were in fact following around Charlie and they were following around Erika, as I told you. And that means people in the NSA, the CIA are confirming that that is real.
