## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Continuing the rest of that email from the person who gave us that tip about this plane, he concludes it by saying, this is the only time that I have noticed that this plane was in Fort Huachuca. If your contact that you mentioned yesterday saw this group of men in the morning, it could line up well with this aircraft leaving at 11.43 a.m. on the 9th. From other searches I've done, it appears that Pam Bondi flew on this plane approximately five months ago from Tampa area back to DC. I am looking into other flights. Please be safe and God bless. Guys, we have a clue. and we should keep going with that. I just, I don't know.
