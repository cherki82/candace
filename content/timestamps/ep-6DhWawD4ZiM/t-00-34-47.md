## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Which is honestly on its face, federal stupidity is what it is. Now, I can also tell you that because my mommy sleuths, they're so fast before stuff even ends, I get tips about things. And Erica literally today sat down with Barry (Barry Weiss). It's been marketed all over. They're going to have this big sit down, a conversation moderated by Barry (Barry Weiss). It's going to feature voices from across the political spectrum and talk about grief. And I got this email after and it's interesting. I got actually a couple of emails, but I'm gonna read this one to you, because it was a town hall-ish event. Here's what they said went down. This person writes, I just came from the CVS by the way, whoever wrote this email, I love you.
