## Transcript

**Erika Kirk:**
> Charlie loved you. It's hard not to get emotional because I know that he would have been the first phone call when he found out that you were going to be taking this position. And the way that I was able to witness the two of you work together for years and to champion and support the president, Was absolutely humbling to witness and I am so proud of you and Charlie is going to be with you every single day in spirit and I will be praying for you every day because I know that this is just the beginning of an incredible opportunity for you and sir, thank you for Allowing Sergio to have this beautiful.
