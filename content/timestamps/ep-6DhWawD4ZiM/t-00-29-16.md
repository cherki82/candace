## Transcript

**Tucker Carlson:**
> Tell me how this guy who seemed normal became a radical, trans, furry murderer? It's not enough to tell me, oh, trans. I'm not pro-trans, by the way. But was that the guy or his boyfriend? Well, exactly. Exactly right. Tell me how this guy became so radicalized that he murdered a stranger. I'm not saying it didn't happen. I'm saying I want an explanation for how it happened. Why wouldn't I? I agree. Oh, we can't talk about that because it'll prejudice the jury pool. Really, you've told the world that you have both a confession from him in his text to his boyfriend And the murder weapon with his fingerprints on it. I think you've got a pretty solid case. So why is it so difficult to just explain?
