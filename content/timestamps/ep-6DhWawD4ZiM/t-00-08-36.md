## Transcript

**Erika Kirk:**
> We are busy building. And you know what I thought? I thought these people are human. We are all grieving in our own way, and they are trying to find the answer to something that happened that was so evil. They are trying so hard, and I get that. We're doing the same. Anytime we hear a lead or anytime we hear anything, we send it to the authorities. Please dig into this. No rock will be unturned. I want justice for my husband, for myself, for my family, more than anyone else out there. So for me, you wanna keep telling me to come down while we're building? I don't have time for that, but here's my breaking point on that. Come after me, call me names, I don't care.
