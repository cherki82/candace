## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> So what that tells me is the call sign from Tucson to Fort Huachuca is a standard reach, everything before that is as well. But once it gets to Fort Huachuca and takes off, it switches to SAM. So that tells me they picked up someone of that stature in Fort Huachuca. And then just to avoid confusion, the Venus call sign is just when the plane is empty, it doesn't have anyone on it. It's actually very, very helpful. And I think, like I said, there's something here. There was definitely something here. And I do believe that God put that man again. He has the worst luck. Our guy, Harry, has the worst luck down, or the best luck down in Fort Huachuca. I'm certainly glad he was there. So you'll definitely be hearing from him directly.
