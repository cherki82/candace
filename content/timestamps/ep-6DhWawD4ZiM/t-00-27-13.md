## Transcript

**Tucker Carlson:**
> If you can't compromise, then I don't see how you're going to be able to lead this organization in the future because Charlie worked, we knew Charlie was, because he was authentic, okay? He didn't just go, well, I only make time for like big pocket donors. He was sitting in college campuses, he was speaking to people, understanding people, he was changing his ideas and he was changing minds. And you are not changing my mind about the fact that something weird happened that day and that TPUSA is acting funny because you give it an impassioned plea and speak about Nehemiah on Fox News. None of it makes any sense.
