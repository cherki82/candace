## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> This isn't just a third world problem. You can contract parasites from your cats, dogs, from riding in an RV, or even from eating sushi. Right now, an estimated four billion people, more than half the planet, are unwilling hosts to parasites. 60 million Americans alone are suffering from parasites. Parasites suppress immunity. They cause some cancers, trigger autoimmune responses, and release toxins that fog your mind and drain your energy. So if you struggle with losing weight, or you suffer from crippling fatigue, anxiety, brain fog, an uncontrollable sweet tooth, or chronic digestive issues, you more than likely could be suffering from a parasite.
