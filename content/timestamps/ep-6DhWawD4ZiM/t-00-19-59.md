## Transcript

And her husband is the first one to report it in the morning. And the cops show up, who happen to be his buddies. They get there, and then they dramatically close the case in 48 hours. And neighbors are like, wait a minute, wait a minute. Excuse me, officers. Actually, you might want to know some other facts here about this guy. Like, you know, he's in the mafia.
