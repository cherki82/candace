## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> And you guys were coming after me because I was saying, look, we can write into our imaginations how Erika (Erika Kirk) is thinking or how she's feeling or what she should be wearing, but she hasn't actually said anything yet. right? That was my stance. She hasn't actually said anything yet. Give her a chance, okay? And now she is making the rounds in the press because Charlie's book, his posthumous book, is coming out about the Sabbath and she's speaking about the quote unquote conspiracies as she sits down with a lot of these news anchors. So first and foremost, she's sitting down here with Harris Faulkner. And I just want to show you a couple of clips from this sit down, which is now trending.
