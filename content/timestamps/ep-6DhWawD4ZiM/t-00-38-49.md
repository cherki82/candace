## Transcript

**Candace Owens:**
> Thank you for your 26 billion emails to let me know that I don't know ish about the military. Okay. It was a human error. I made it very clear that I am just, I am ignorant when it comes to military. I will own that. And so please just Be nice to me sometimes where it's a lot of information, a lot of researching, and I just wanted to confirm he said he was where he said he was and take those notes. But no, he did not. He was very clear. I checked the notes that he has said, oh, six. I think I made the mistake when I transferred my notes because he said colonels or captains. Then I was I googled it and then I edited it thinking that maybe I heard him wrong. It was over a one hour phone call.
